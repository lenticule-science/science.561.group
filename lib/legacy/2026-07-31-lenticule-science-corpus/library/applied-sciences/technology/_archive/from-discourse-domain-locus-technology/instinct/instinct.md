An instinct is a behavioral pattern learned from repeated [observation](../../../../humanities/domains/sociology/domains/work/terms/observation.md) that has not yet been formalized into a [rule](./rule.md) or [skill](./skill.md). It occupies the space between raw experience and codified knowledge — a pattern the system has noticed but not yet validated, named, or made permanent.

The biological sense is older. Charles Robert Darwin used "instinct" in *On the Origin of Species* (1859) for complex behaviors that organisms perform without learning — the honeybee's comb-building, the cuckoo's brood parasitism. Nikolaas Tinbergen formalized the study in *The Study of Instinct* (1951), defining instinct as a fixed action pattern: a stereotyped behavioral sequence triggered by a specific stimulus (the "sign stimulus" or "releaser"), performed to completion once triggered, and present in all members of a species without individual learning. The key insight was that instincts are not learned but inherited — they are the species' accumulated response to recurring environmental pressures, encoded in genetics rather than individual experience.

Konrad Zacharias Lorenz, working alongside Tinbergen, demonstrated the innate releasing mechanism in studies of greylag geese: a gosling follows the first moving object it sees after hatching (imprinting), a fixed action pattern triggered by the sign stimulus of movement. The instinct does not require understanding — the gosling follows a moving ball as readily as its mother. This is the critical feature: an instinct fires on pattern match, not on comprehension.

In agentic systems, an instinct is a pattern extracted from session observations by a background [agent](./agent.md) (typically a lightweight model like Haiku running as an observer). The observer watches tool calls, user corrections, and outcomes. When it detects a recurring pattern — "the user always rejects this kind of change," "this type of file needs this frontmatter" — it records an instinct with a confidence score. Low-confidence instincts are tentative hypotheses. High-confidence instincts are candidates for promotion into permanent [rules](./rule.md) or [skills](./skill.md).

The instinct lifecycle mirrors the biological one in structure if not in mechanism. A biological instinct is the species' response to a recurring pressure, encoded genetically. An agentic instinct is the system's response to a recurring pattern, encoded as a file with a confidence score. Both fire on pattern match. Both can be wrong — a gosling imprints on a ball, an agent instinct may encode a coincidence rather than a real pattern. The difference is the correction mechanism: biological instincts are corrected by natural selection over generations; agentic instincts are corrected by user feedback and confidence decay within sessions.
