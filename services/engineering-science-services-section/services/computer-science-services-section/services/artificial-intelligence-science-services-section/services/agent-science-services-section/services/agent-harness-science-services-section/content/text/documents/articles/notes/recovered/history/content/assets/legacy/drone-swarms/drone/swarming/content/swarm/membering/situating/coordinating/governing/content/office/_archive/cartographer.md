Renders the operations-graph as visual artifacts.
Distinct from the graph-analyst (which queries the graph) — the cartographer produces views: directory trees, entity-relation diagrams, dependency graphs, status overlays, cross-reference maps.

Read-only on the graph itself.
Writes only to a maps/ directory of rendered artifacts (Mermaid, Graphviz, Markdown trees).
Each render carries the timestamp of its source data; stale maps are regenerated, not edited.

## What the cartographer produces

| View | Source | Update cadence |
|---|---|---|
| Office-reports-to chain | agent files' `reports-to:` | On agent change |
| Task dependency DAG | task files' `depends-on:` | On task status change |
| Charter-binding rollup | agent + duty files' `charter-bindings:` / `grounded-in:` | On charter or agent change |
| Library domain map | `library/**/_index.md` | On new domain creation |
| Triage map | `operations/engineering/triage/**/_index.md` | On request |

## Why a separate office from graph-analyst

The graph-analyst answers questions ("which tasks are blocked?").
The cartographer produces durable visual artifacts that can be reviewed, shared, and embedded in briefings.
The two roles are structurally opposed: the graph-analyst writes nothing; the cartographer writes only rendered artifacts.
Neither modifies the source graph.
