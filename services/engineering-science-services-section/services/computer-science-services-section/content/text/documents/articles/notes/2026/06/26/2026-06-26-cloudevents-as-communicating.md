title: "CloudEvents as communicating"
description: "Places CloudEvents as communicating's standard structured JSON across-envelope for membrane utterances. A CloudEvent is a charged meme with a standard envelope: source is the token/who, type is the Searle illocutionary force, time is T, and data is the claim. Records the carrier mapping, utterance bridge, green law test, and open seams."

CloudEvents belongs to **communicating's across face**.
It is not a second event ontology beside relating's utterances.
It is the CNCF standard envelope for the same membrane act already carried as `UtteranceCarrier`: someone says something, with a force, at a time, and the structured JSON envelope makes that act portable across event routers.

The implemented brick is in [`lib/communicating/src/messaging/cloudevents.mts`](../../../lib/communicating/src/messaging/cloudevents.mts).

## The derivation

A CloudEvent is a charged meme with a standard envelope:

- `source` is the utterance token, the who.
- `type` is the Searle illocutionary force.
- `time` is the witness time `T`.
- `data` is the claim.

So the bridge is:

```ts
source / type / time / data
  =
token / force / T / claim
```

The CloudEvents JSON Event Format supplies the structured envelope.
The package uses the literal constants it needs:

- `specversion = "1.0"`
- structured JSON media type `application/cloudevents+json`
- claim content type `application/json`

No SDK, JSON-LD processor, or eventing framework is introduced.
The carrier is an `as const` JSON-Schema literal admitted through relating's `carrierFrom`, and the TypeScript type is derived with `FromSchema`.

## What landed

- `cloudEventCarrier`: structured JSON CloudEvent carrier for one membrane utterance.
- `cloudEventFromUtterance`: `UtteranceCarrier -> CloudEvent`, with caller-supplied force and `T`.
- `utteranceFromCloudEvent`: `CloudEvent -> UtteranceCarrier`, preserving `source/data` as `token/claim`.
- `cloudEventIllocutionaryForce`: reads `type` as the same Searle force vocabulary used by the ActivityPub codec.
- Literal constants for `specversion`, structured JSON media type, and JSON data content type.

The implementation requires JSON claims because structured CloudEvents JSON stores `data` directly as JSON.
Non-JSON claims should be encoded by a separate content codec before entering this envelope.

## Proof

The law test is [`lib/communicating/test/cloudevents.test.mjs`](../../../lib/communicating/test/cloudevents.test.mjs).
It checks:

- `source/type/time/data` round-trip losslessly with `token/force/T/claim`.
- `CloudEvent -> utterance -> CloudEvent` returns the same canonical envelope when the required CloudEvents `id` is preserved.
- CloudEvents `type` maps to the same Searle force that the ActivityPub codec reads for `Create`, `Question`, `Accept`, `Like`, and `Undo`.

That proves the intended joint: CloudEvents is a functorial view of the existing utterance carrier plus speech-act force.
It adds a standard envelope, not a second ontology.

## Provenance

This brick derives from the family registry's product-plane recipe and the protocols map's second-wave CloudEvents entry.
The CloudEvents spec supplies the standard structured JSON envelope; the package supplies the mathematical reading: `source/type/time/data` is exactly `token/force/T/claim`.
