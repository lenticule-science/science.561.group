# Progression design — what the research found, and where tab stands

The brief from `next-gen-engine-architecture.md` is a *living* world that produces stories nobody
scripted; tab's substrate is an emergence engine (simple algebra over fibers, outcomes computed not
listed). Progression is the other axis — how a player *grows* across a session. This note brings the
outside research on progression alongside tab's one shipped progression mechanic — **advancement as
the crossing of a settlement/closure threshold, NOT a designed level number** — and asks what the
research says tab should and should not add. **FACTS** (the literature) and **tab** (proposals,
marked) are kept apart.

The headline: the field's deepest distinction is between progression that is **numbers going up**
(extrinsic, and — per motivation psychology — actively risky) and progression that is **capability
that opens the world** (intrinsic). tab's closure-threshold advancement is *structurally* the second
kind. The danger is reflexively adding the first — an XP bar — on top of it.

## FACTS — Juul: games of emergence vs. games of progression

Jesper Juul (*Half-Real*, 2005; "The Open and the Closed," 2002) draws the field's foundational
distinction:

- **Emergence** — "a number of simple rules combining to form interesting variation." The challenges
  are not placed by the designer; they *arise* from rule interaction. Open structure, high
  replayability, many strategies. Pre-electronic games (chess, cards) are emergence games. Emergence
  games have *strategy guides* (general tactics).
- **Progression** — "the player has to perform a predefined set of actions in order to complete the
  game." Challenges are placed *serially* by the designer, granting "strong control to the game
  designer" — good for cinematic/storytelling ambition, but risking "playing a game on a rail … the
  work of the player is simply to perform the correct pre-defined moves." Progression is the
  *historically newer* structure, entering via the adventure genre. Progression games have
  *walkthroughs* (the exact action sequence).

Juul's diagnostic is sharp and usable: **if your progression can be written as a walkthrough, it is
the on-a-rail kind.** Emergence is where the unscriptable story lives. The two are not exclusive —
most games mix them — but the axis tells you which kind of "growth" you are building.

## FACTS — Deci & Ryan: intrinsic vs extrinsic, and why XP can hurt

Self-Determination Theory (Edward Deci & Richard Ryan, 1980s onward) is the field's account of *why*
people do things. Three basic psychological needs drive self-initiated behavior: **autonomy,
competence, relatedness.** Motivation runs on a continuum from amotivation through *external
regulation* (acting for rewards/punishments) up to *intrinsic motivation* (acting for the inherent
satisfaction of the act).

The finding that matters most for progression design is the **overjustification effect** (a.k.a. the
undermining effect), among SDT's most-replicated and most counterintuitive results: **adding an
extrinsic, expected, contingent reward to an activity that was already intrinsically interesting
*reduces* the intrinsic motivation for it.** Deci's 1971 puzzle experiments are the canonical case:
people solved puzzles happily for free; paying them increased output *while pay lasted*; **removing
the pay dropped their motivation and performance below the original baseline.** Tangible rewards given
contingent on engagement/completion/performance undermined intrinsic motivation; *expected* rewards
undermined it, *unexpected* ones did not.

The direct game-design consequence, stated repeatedly in the gamification literature: **a visible XP
number, points, or achievement bar attached to an activity the player already enjoyed can crowd out
that enjoyment** — the player reorients from "I'm doing this because it's interesting" to "I'm doing
this for the number." Short-term engagement spikes; long-term intrinsic motivation erodes. XP is not
free; it can be a *cost*.

The constructive reading of SDT: progression that feeds **competence** (the player can now *do* more)
and **autonomy** (the player chose this growth) reinforces intrinsic motivation; progression that is
*only* an externally-administered number contingent on grinding undermines it.

## FACTS — Csikszentmihalyi: the flow channel and the difficulty curve

Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's **flow** is the state of complete absorption where challenge and skill are
balanced. On the challenge-vs-skill graph, the **flow channel** is the diagonal band: above it
(challenge ≫ skill) is **anxiety**; below it (skill ≫ challenge) is **boredom**. Optimal design keeps
the player in the channel — challenge slightly above current skill, so overcoming it delivers a small
climax of satisfaction. Because skill *rises* as the player improves, **difficulty must rise with it**
to stay in the channel; this is the principle behind the difficulty curve and educational
scaffolding.

The progression-relevant corollary: **progression's real job is to keep the player in the flow
channel as their skill grows** — not to make a number bigger. When a level-up actually expands what
the player can attempt (new challenges that re-balance against grown skill), progression serves flow.
When a level-up only inflates stats against unchanged challenges, the player slides *below* the
channel into boredom — the content trivializes.

## FACTS — the treadmill critique and "meaningful progression"

The **treadmill** (or grind) critique is the field's standing warning. Repetitive low-intensity tasks
hold players in a *mild* flow state that is excellent for session length and habit — and that is
exactly the danger: grinding can become "a manipulative retention treadmill that exploits
psychological vulnerabilities," especially when paired with monetization shortcuts, producing burnout
and eroded trust. The treadmill is progression-as-numbers-going-up taken to its logical end: the
number always climbs, the *world* never opens, the player runs in place.

Against this the field sets **meaningful progression**: growth that **opens the world** — new
capabilities, areas, interactions, and *kinds* of challenge — rather than growth that merely scales
numbers. The test is diagnostic: *after this advancement, can the player do something they could not
do before, that changes how they engage the world?* If yes, it is meaningful; if it only lets them do
the same thing to bigger numbers, it is treadmill. This is the same axis as Juul's (capability that
opens vs. a rail of predefined gains) and Deci & Ryan's (competence/autonomy vs. an extrinsic
number).

## tab — mapping the findings onto closure-threshold advancement

tab ships **skills via `#practicing`/`#advancing`**, where **"advancement = crossing a
settlement/closure threshold, NOT a designed level number."** Read through the research, this single
design choice lands tab on the *intrinsic / meaningful / emergent* side of every axis above.
(Everything here is reading/proposal unless it cites shipped behavior.)

### tab — closure-threshold advancement IS the intrinsic kind, structurally

Deci & Ryan warn that an *externally-administered, contingent number* (XP) undermines intrinsic
motivation. tab's advancement is **not an administered number** — it is a *property of the player's
own fiber crossing a closure/settlement threshold*. You do not earn XP toward a level the designer
set; your fiber *settles* through practice (`#practicing` accumulating evidence) until a cell closes,
and the closure *is* the advancement (`#advancing`). The growth is **endogenous** — it is the fiber's
own state, not a reward handed in from outside. In SDT terms this feeds **competence** directly (you
advanced because you actually became settled/capable) without the extrinsic-reward hook that triggers
overjustification. tab gets the *intrinsic* shape for free, because advancement is a fact about the
player's fiber, not a payout.

### tab — advancement opens the world (meaningful, not treadmill) because value is computed

The treadmill is numbers-going-up while the world stays closed. tab structurally *can't* do
pure-number progression, because **there is no level number** — and because, per
`economy-is-predicate-richness.md`, a richer fiber is one that **more messages compose with**
(`composes(target, message)` true on more channels; "available actions are COMPUTED, not listed").
So when your fiber settles a new cell, **the world literally opens** — `respond` affords more non-⊥
actions against more targets. Advancement is *definitionally* capability-that-opens-the-world, the
field's gold standard for "meaningful progression," and it is mechanical, not aspirational: more
settled fiber = more affordance = more world reachable. There is no version of tab advancement that
is "the same action against a bigger number," because the gain is *new composing channels*, not a
scalar.

### tab — emergence is the substrate; progression rides on it without a rail

Juul's diagnostic — *can it be written as a walkthrough?* — cuts cleanly. tab's core is an
**emergence engine**: `respond`/fold arithmetic over fibers, outcomes *computed* from rule
interaction, not placed by a designer (`next-gen-engine-architecture.md`: "one algebra, no
subsystems"; the demo's goal is "a story nobody scripted"). Advancement-by-closure does **not**
introduce a progression rail, because *which* cells settle, and therefore *which* capabilities open,
depends on the emergent history of play (what you practiced, against what, in what order) — there is
no predefined action sequence to walk through. So tab can have genuine *progression* (the player
grows) while staying a *game of emergence* (no walkthrough), which the literature treats as the hard
combination to achieve. The closure threshold is the hinge: it is a progression *event* whose
*trigger* is an emergent fiber state.

### tab — the fold is the flow-channel governor (and the inflation risk)

Csikszentmihalyi says progression's job is to keep the player in the flow channel as skill rises.
tab's **tower-`fold`** is, read this way, a flow-channel mechanism: as entities settle, they become
**vocabulary atoms** the world can build *new, higher-order* structure from — so a settled player
faces freshly-composed higher-order challenges rather than trivialized old ones. Settlement raises
both the player's skill *and* the ceiling of available challenge, holding the channel. But the
existing economy note's warning is the same warning in flow terms: **"inflation = the tower
outrunning settlement."** If the fold mints challenge-vocabulary faster than the player settles, the
player is pushed *above* the channel into anxiety (the world outruns them); if it mints too slowly,
*below* into boredom. So tab's faucet/sink balance from `virtual-economies.md` and the flow channel
are the *same* governor: **settled-vs-minted ratio is both the inflation diagnostic and the
flow-channel position.** (Fold deferred per `next-gen-engine-architecture.md`; this is the reading of
it.)

### tab — the one thing NOT to bolt on: an XP bar

The clearest actionable warning the research gives tab is *negative*. tab's advancement is already the
intrinsic, meaningful, emergent kind. The tempting "next feature" — a visible XP number, a level, a
progress bar quoting distance-to-next-level — is **exactly the extrinsic, contingent, expected reward
the overjustification effect says will undermine the intrinsic motivation tab's closure threshold
already supplies.** Surfacing advancement is fine and good (the player should *feel* their fiber
settling) — but it should be surfaced as **legible capability** ("you can now do X / Y composes
now"), the competence signal SDT endorses, *not* as a number-toward-a-designed-threshold, which
re-imports the treadmill tab structurally avoided. The renderer already shows fiber state and ⊤;
showing *newly-afforded actions* on settlement is the SDT-correct surfacing. A number is the one thing
to resist.

## What tab is ahead on, and the one discipline to keep

Tallying against the field: intrinsic progression (Deci & Ryan) — tab has it structurally, because
advancement is an endogenous fiber-closure, not an administered reward. Meaningful progression
(opens-the-world, not numbers-up) — tab has it definitionally, because a richer fiber is more
affordance, not a bigger scalar. Progression-within-emergence (Juul's hard combination) — tab has it,
because the closure *trigger* is emergent (no walkthrough) while the closure *event* is real growth.
Flow-channel maintenance (Csikszentmihalyi) — the fold is the governor, with the inflation/anxiety
risk made literal as settled-vs-minted ratio.

The one discipline to keep is the *negative* one: **do not bolt an extrinsic XP number onto a system
that is already intrinsically motivating.** The research's strongest, most counterintuitive finding —
the overjustification effect — is precisely a warning against the most reflexive "progression
feature" in the genre. tab's advancement is good *because* it is a settlement threshold and not a
level. Surface the capability; resist the number.
