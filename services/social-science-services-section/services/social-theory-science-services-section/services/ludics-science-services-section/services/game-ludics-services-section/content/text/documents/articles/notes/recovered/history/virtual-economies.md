The headline: the discipline's hardest-won lesson is that a virtual economy is a faucet/sink flow problem, and tab's needs/resource-depletion loop is a faucet with almost no sinks, while richness-as-value and trade-as-dual-filing already give tab a NATIVE economy the field had to bolt on.

# Virtual economies — what the field found, and where tab stands

The existing note `economy-is-predicate-richness.md` argues that in tab the economy is not a
subsystem: value IS fiber richness, trade IS dual-filed `located-in`, scarcity IS settledness,
contested value IS ⊤. That note reasons from the predication-world-sim doc and tab's code. This
note brings the outside discipline — twenty-odd years of people studying real shipping virtual
economies — alongside it, and asks where their hard-won lessons land on tab's machinery. The two
halves are kept apart: **FACTS** (what the literature reports) and **tab** (proposals, marked).

The single most load-bearing finding is not about value at all. It is about *flow*: a virtual
economy lives or dies on the balance between **faucets** (where currency and items enter) and
**sinks** (where they leave). tab today has a strong faucet story and almost no sinks. That is the
gap this note exists to name.

## FACTS — the founding measurements (Castronova)

Edward Castronova (PhD economics, Wisconsin 1991; professor at Indiana) wrote the first serious
economics of a virtual world. His 2001 paper *Virtual Worlds: A First-Hand Account of Market and
Society on the Cyberian Frontier* treated EverQuest's planet **Norrath** as a real economy and
measured it: by valuing Norrathian goods against the eBay price of the platinum-piece currency
(~120 platinum to US$1 in 2001), he computed a **GNP per capita of about US$2,000**, which placed
Norrath's per-capita output **77th in the world — between Russia and Bulgaria**, with an implied
aggregate around US$135 million. The point was not the number but the claim it licensed: virtual
goods are *genuinely scarce* and therefore have *real value*, so the tools of economics apply
without apology.

His 2005 book *Synthetic Worlds: The Business and Culture of Online Games* generalizes: conditions
of **scarcity, specialization, and comparative advantage** inside a synthetic world reproduce the
properties of contemporary economies, so economic theory can be used to *study* — and to *design* —
them. The founding move of the whole field is exactly the move the existing tab note makes from the
other direction: there is no clean line between "the game" and "the economy."

## FACTS — faucets and sinks, mudflation, decay (Lehdonvirta & Castronova)

Vili Lehdonvirta and Castronova's *Virtual Economies: Design and Analysis* (MIT Press, 2014) is the
field's textbook. Its frame: a virtual economy is built from **markets, institutions, and money**
over **artificially scarce** goods, and the designer's central job is to manage the **flow** of
those goods through the system. The operational vocabulary:

- **Faucet** — any source that *creates* new currency or items: a mob drop, a quest reward, a
  completed dungeon, a gathered resource node, a crafted output. Every kill, quest, and gather is a
  faucet.
- **Sink** — any drain that *destroys* currency or items, removing them from circulation: repair
  costs, transaction taxes, item decay/breakage, NPC vendor purchases, consumables, fees, and
  high-priced low-utility "money-burning" goods.
- **Mudflation** (the MUD-era term) — when the continued operation of the world makes
  previously-acquired wealth and gear *decline in value*, because the uninterrupted flow from
  faucets outpaces the sinks. The canonical statement: **"without sinks, there will be inflation."**

The design lesson is blunt and repeated across the literature: **faucets are easy and fun to add,
sinks are hard and unpopular, and a world that only adds faucets inflates until its currency is
worthless.** Concrete sinks that shipped and worked:

- **WoW repair costs** — gear loses durability with use and must be repaired for gold; a *dynamic*
  sink, because repair bills scale with character level, so the drain grows as the faucet grows.
- **WoW auction-house cut** — a *percentage* tax on sales; because it is a percentage, it removes
  *more* gold in absolute terms exactly when prices are inflating, a self-strengthening sink.
- **EverQuest / RuneScape money-burners** — mounts, houses (RuneScape Construction sinks millions
  building a player house), and prestige goods with low intrinsic utility, sold expressly to soak up
  excess currency.
- **Ultima Online blue armor / Kingdom of Loathing collectibles** — items priced high but with
  little gameplay benefit, introduced purely as sinks.

Two structural subtleties the book stresses: (1) the best sinks are **dynamic** — they scale with
wealth (percentage taxes, level-scaled repair) so the drain tracks the faucet automatically rather
than needing constant hand-tuning; (2) **item decay is itself a sink** — gear that wears out keeps
demand for new gear alive, so the crafting faucet has somewhere to flow *to*. A world with durable,
never-decaying items and an ever-flowing crafting faucet floods itself.

## FACTS — EVE Online: the player-driven single shard

EVE Online is the field's living laboratory because it is almost entirely **player-driven** and runs
on a **single shard** — one universe, one market, every player in the same economy rather than
sharded copies. CCP Games employed economists and publishes **Monthly Economic Reports** with money
supply, faucet/sink breakdowns, production, and trade — central-bank-style instrumentation of a game
economy.

Two facts matter most for tab:

- **Destruction is the primary sink.** In EVE, ships and modules are *consumed* — when a ship is
  destroyed in combat it is gone, and its replacement must be re-mined, re-manufactured, and
  re-bought. The **Battle of B-R5RB** (January 2014, ~7,548 characters, 21 hours) destroyed over **11
  trillion ISK** of ships, an estimated US$300,000–330,000 of real value, in a single battle. That
  is a colossal *sink event*: it pulled enormous accumulated value out of circulation and created
  fresh demand all the way down the production chain. EVE's loss-is-permanent design is what keeps
  its economy from drowning in its own faucets.
- **Production chains and comparative advantage are the content.** Because players have different
  opportunity costs, not everyone is suited to every task, so **specialization and a division of
  labor** emerge: miners, refiners, manufacturers, haulers, traders, each depending on the others
  through "intricate networks of interdependence." The economy is not a menu of vendor prices; it is
  an emergent web of who-makes-what-for-whom. EVE's total in-game value was estimated around US$18M
  (2014) — but the interesting quantity is the *structure* of trade, not its sum.

## FACTS — gold-farming and RMT as an economic attack

Real-money trading (RMT) — selling in-game currency, items, or characters for real cash — and the
**gold-farming** (often botted) that supplies it are studied as **negative externalities** and, in
the field's own framing, as an **economic attack** on the world. Castronova analyzed RMT with
ordinary supply-and-demand. The mechanism of harm: gold farmers run an **industrial faucet** —
monopolizing high-yield resource nodes, botting kills around the clock — that floods the currency
supply far faster than designed, driving **artificial inflation** that disadvantages players who earn
honestly. Lehdonvirta's framing is that RMT is "like pollution" of the service the designers are
trying to provide. The research direction is mostly **detection** (trading-network analysis, anomaly
detection on player-driven markets) — finding the attacker by the abnormal *shape* of their flow,
not by any single transaction.

The deep point for any economy design: an attacker who can mint currency cheaply (a bot farm) is
attacking the **faucet/sink balance** itself. Defenses are either better sinks (so excess drains
out) or detecting and closing the abnormal faucet.

## tab — mapping the findings onto the running machinery

The existing note already claims tab has a *native* economy. The field's findings sharpen exactly
*which* parts are native and *which* part is missing. (Everything in this section is proposal /
reading, not built behavior unless it cites shipped code.)

### tab — richness-as-value and trade-as-dual-filing ARE the native economy

What Castronova had to *argue into existence* — that virtual goods have real, scarcity-grounded value
and that "the economy IS the game" — tab has by construction. `economy-is-predicate-richness.md`
already grounds this: value is the determined-cell count of a settled fiber (`being(...).fiber`),
computed not assigned; trade is two dual-filed `located-in` legs, which is **double-entry accounting
for free** — the field builds ledgers; tab's EAVT *is* the ledger. So tab does not need to bolt on a
market data structure to *have* prices: a `richness(thing)` read quotes value directly. This is the
half tab is *ahead* on.

### tab — needs/resource-depletion IS a faucet/sink loop, but it is mostly faucet

This is the load-bearing map. tab ships **needs/resources that DEPLETE** (the scarcity layer) and
**`#crafting`** (fiber fusion, recipes-as-data). Read through the field's vocabulary:

- A **gathered/crafted output** is a **faucet** — a `#crafting` fusion mints a new rich fiber; a
  resource node yields material. Faucets, tab has.
- A **depleting need** (hunger draining, a resource node emptying) is a **consumption sink** — value
  leaves when food is eaten or a node runs dry. So tab has *one* genuine sink class already:
  consumption.
- **The gap:** tab has *consumption* sinks but no obvious **durability/decay sink** on crafted goods,
  no **transaction-tax sink** on trade, no **money-burner sink**. The field's blunt lesson —
  "without sinks, there will be inflation" — predicts that as soon as tab has persistent players
  crafting, the world fills with durable rich fibers and their value mudflates. A sword's fiber, once
  fused, does not wear out; `#crafting` is a faucet with no matching item-decay sink.

So the field-grounded proposal is a **decay sink expressed in tab's own terms**: an item's fiber
*loses determined cells over use/time* — a `#degrading` move (the inverse of `#advancing`) that
supersedes determined cells back toward ⊥, lowering `richness` and so lowering quoted value. Because
value IS richness, *decay needs no separate durability number*: a worn sword is literally a thinner
fiber. This is item-decay-as-a-sink rendered natively — the field's sink, but as fiber arithmetic,
not a bolted-on durability stat.

A second native sink is the **transaction tax**: because trade is a dual-filed `located-in` exchange,
a percentage sink is one extra leg that retires a fraction of the exchanged richness to ⊥ (or to a
"world" anchor). The field's strongest sink — a *percentage* drain that scales with the trade — falls
out of the `trade({give, take})` move sketched in the existing note's addendum with one added leg.

### tab — the fold IS the mudflation mechanism, made literal

`economy-is-predicate-richness.md` already records the claim "inflation IS the tower expanding faster
than settlement … more tokens than there are stable values backing them," and notes the tower/fold is
the deferred growth layer (`grow.mjs` to be ported). The field gives this a precise external name:
**mudflation is faucets outrunning sinks.** In tab those are the same statement: the fold mints new
vocabulary atoms (faucet) and *settlement* is what backs them (the sink-side stability). So the
diagnostic the existing note names — "the ratio of freshly-minted predications to settled functional
cells" — is exactly the field's faucet/sink ratio. tab can, in principle, *instrument its own
mudflation* the way CCP instruments EVE: a Monthly-Economic-Report-style read over the fold reporting
minted-vs-settled. The instrumentation is a pure read; tab has the substrate for it once the fold runs.

### tab — gold-farming/RMT as an attack on the faucet/sink ratio

The field studies RMT as an industrial faucet detected by the abnormal *shape* of its flow. tab's
substrate is unusually well-suited to this defense because the world IS an append-only,
content-addressed trace: a bot's industrial faucet appears as an abnormal *density* of mint events
(`#crafting`/gather faucets) at one anchor, and trade is dual-filed so every transfer is locally
auditable from both sides. The field's "detect the attacker by the shape of their flow" is, in tab,
a read over the trace's faucet density per anchor — the same minted-vs-settled instrument, narrowed
to one subject. (Proposal; no detection code exists.)

### tab — comparative advantage and production chains as emergent, not authored

EVE's lesson is that the *content* is the emergent web of specialization, not a vendor menu. tab's
crafting is **recipes-as-data** and value is **computed** from fiber richness, so a production chain
(ore → ingot → blade → sword) is just a sequence of `#crafting` fusions, each raising richness, each a
faucet feeding the next stage's input. Comparative advantage emerges if different entities have
different fibers (different settled skills via `#practicing`/`#advancing`), making them better at
different fusions — which is exactly tab's skill model. So the *interdependence web* EVE grows by
hand-balancing, tab grows from the algebra: who-can-make-what is a fact about whose fiber composes
with which recipe (`composes(target, message)`), computed, not assigned. The note `next-gen-engine-
architecture.md` flags the demo world as where this gets exercised; this is the economic content of
that demo.

## What tab is ahead on, and the one loop it must close

Tallying against the field: value-with-real-scarcity (Castronova's founding argument) and
the-economy-is-the-game and double-entry trade — tab has these by construction, where the field had
to build or argue them. Comparative-advantage production chains — tab grows from the skill/crafting
algebra rather than hand-balancing. The fold gives mudflation a literal mechanism and a free
diagnostic.

The one thing tab is *behind* on is the field's hardest, least glamorous lesson: **sinks.** tab is
strong on faucets (crafting, gathering) and has only consumption sinks (depleting needs). Without a
**decay sink** (fiber thinning, expressed as `#degrading`) and ideally a **transaction-tax sink** (an
extra `located-in` leg retiring richness), tab's economy will mudflate the moment it runs at scale —
and the beautiful part is that *both sinks are native*: decay is just richness flowing back toward ⊥,
tax is one more dual-filed leg. The economy is the algebra; the missing piece is the half of the
algebra that *removes* value, not the half that makes it.
