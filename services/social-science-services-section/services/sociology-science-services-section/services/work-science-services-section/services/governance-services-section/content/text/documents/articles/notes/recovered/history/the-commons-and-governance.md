# The commons and governance

TAB's `decide` already produces a tragedy of the commons. Not as a designed challenge — as the bare
equilibrium of its rules: an NPC at a resource raises its own need and decrements the resource's
`amount` by one, the pool is shared, nothing replenishes it inside the move, so a world of pure
`decide`-agents draws every provider to zero and then starves at `idle`. This is the single most
important governance fact about a multiplayer TAB, and it is not hypothetical — it is what
`being/doing/responding/deciding/scripts/decide.mjs` does today. The literature that matters here is
the literature on how shared resources are *actually* governed without collapse, and TAB has the
machinery to build those governance systems from parts it already ships. As with all notes here, the
theory below is what the cited works say; the TAB mappings are proposals, marked as such.

## Theory-facts: Hardin vs Ostrom

**Hardin's tragedy (1968).** Garrett Hardin, "The Tragedy of the Commons" (*Science* 162, 1968),
argued that a resource open to all is doomed: each user reaps the *full* private benefit of taking one
more unit (one more cow on the common pasture) while the *cost* of degradation is spread across all
users and deferred. So the rational individual always takes more, every individual reasons the same
way, and the commons is destroyed — "ruin is the destination toward which all men rush, each pursuing
his own best interest." Hardin's prescribed escapes were stark: either *privatize* the resource (cut
it into owned parcels) or impose *central state coercion* ("mutual coercion, mutually agreed upon").
He saw no third way.

**Ostrom's correction (1990).** Elinor Ostrom, *Governing the Commons* (Cambridge University Press,
1990; Nobel 2009), showed empirically that Hardin was wrong about the third way. Her central
distinction: Hardin conflated an **open-access** resource (no rules, no boundary, anyone takes
anything) with a **common-pool resource** (rivalrous and hard to exclude from, but *governed* by a
defined community). Open-access does collapse. Common-pool resources, Ostrom documented across
centuries of field cases — Swiss alpine pastures, Japanese village forests, Spanish *huerta*
irrigation, Philippine and Nepali water systems — are routinely managed sustainably by their
communities *without* privatization and *without* a central state, through self-organized
institutions. The communities solve the dilemma themselves.

**Ostrom's eight design principles.** From the long-enduring cases she abstracted eight design
principles that successful common-pool governance shares:

1. **Clearly defined boundaries** — who may draw on the resource, and where the resource ends.
2. **Proportional equivalence between benefits and costs** — appropriation rules fit local
   conditions; those who take more (or benefit more) contribute more.
3. **Collective-choice arrangements** — those affected by the rules can participate in changing them.
4. **Monitoring** — the resource and the appropriators are watched, by monitors who are accountable
   to (often *are*) the users themselves.
5. **Graduated sanctions** — violators face penalties that *start small* and escalate with the
   severity and repetition of the offence; not instant exile, but a warning, then a fine, then
   exclusion.
6. **Fast, cheap conflict-resolution mechanisms** — low-cost local arenas to settle disputes.
7. **Minimal recognition of rights to organize** — the community's right to make its own rules is
   recognized (not overridden) by external authority.
8. **Nested enterprises** — for larger systems, governance is layered in nested tiers rather than one
   monolithic authority.

The mechanism underneath these is the game theory of the companion note: monitoring + reputation +
graduated sanctions convert a one-shot Prisoner's Dilemma into an indefinitely repeated game with
recognizable, history-bearing partners, in which conditional cooperation is the equilibrium (Folk
Theorem; Axelrod's tit-for-tat; Nowak & Sigmund's indirect reciprocity). Ostrom's principles are,
read through the companion note, the *engineering* of the conditions under which cooperation is an ESS.
Olson's *The Logic of Collective Action* (1965) supplies the contrast Ostrom answers: large anonymous
groups free-ride and fail to provision public goods *unless* the group is small enough, or structured
enough, for contributions to be monitored — which is exactly the structure Ostrom's principles supply.

## TAB-proposals: Ostrom's principles as emergent systems

These are proposals for how TAB builds Ostrom's governance from machinery it already has. The point is
that none of them is a scripted "be cooperative" rule — each is an incentive structure that makes
cooperation pay.

**The tragedy is already TAB's default.** `decide`'s co-located `use` move
(`{ subject: resource, predicate: "amount", object: Math.max(0, amount - 1) }`) is the cow on the
common pasture: private benefit to the user (`need:<x>` raised), shared and deferred cost (the pool
drops for everyone, forever). `resourcesFor` drops any provider with `amount <= 0`, so depletion is
terminal within the current rules. TAB ships Hardin's *open-access* world. The work is to make it a
governed *common-pool* world — to add Ostrom's principles as systems, not to rewrite `decide` into a
saint.

**Boundaries and proportionality (principles 1–2): cells on the resource and the actor.** Boundaries
are data: a resource can carry a `governed-by:<faction>` cell and an actor a `member-of:<faction>`
cell, so "who may draw" is a read, not a hardcode. Proportionality is the richness signal the economy
note already proposes — `richnessOf` quotes worth, so a draw can cost in proportion to benefit (an
actor that takes more owes more), turning the free decrement into a *priced* appropriation. Both are
appends; neither needs new substrate.

**Monitoring (principle 4) is free — the log is public and ambient.** This is TAB's structural gift.
The world is an append-only EAVT log; every `use` that depletes a resource is a row anyone can read,
and observation in TAB is *ambient* (a row filed at a place is visible to co-located observers through
their Umwelt). So monitoring — the principle Ostrom found communities must spend real effort to
arrange — is the substrate's default: over-drawing is *witnessed by construction*, not by a watchman.
Proposal: the public, content-addressed, replayable log IS the monitoring institution. A draw is a
public act with a permanent record; there is nowhere to consume in secret.

**Reputation and graduated sanctions (principle 5) via `socialize`.** Because monitoring is automatic,
sanctions can be social. `socialize` files `opinion-of:<other>` cells (friend / rival / neutral /
ambivalent) by composing fibers; a witnessed over-draw is negative evidence on the over-drawer that
shifts others' opinions toward `rival`. Graduation falls out naturally and *without a threshold table*
if sanction severity reads the *recorded history*: a first offence is one negative cell (a cooler
stance, a warning); repetition accumulates more (settling toward `rival`, then refusal to trade, then
faction-wide exclusion). The sanction ladder is the accruing public record, read at the moment of the
next interaction — which is exactly graduated, community-administered punishment, emergent from the
opinion mechanism rather than scripted. Crucially, the sanction is a *withheld future benefit* (trade
refused, resource access revoked), so it costs the sanctioner nothing and prices defection for the
defector — the Folk-Theorem punishment that makes cooperation the equilibrium.

**Factions as the nested, collective-choice, conflict-resolution layer (principles 3, 6, 8).** A
faction is an entity with members (`member-of`) and governed resources (`governed-by`); its rules are
cells, changeable by appends from members (collective choice); disputes are resolved by reading the
faction's recorded stance and, where contested, by the bilattice. Nesting (principle 8) is the natural
shape of content-addressed entities: a faction is an entity, factions can belong to larger entities,
governance layers without a monolith. Proposal: factions are not a new subsystem but a *naming
convention over the existing opinion/membership cells* — the same `socialize`/`opinion-of` machinery
read at the group level (a faction's stance toward an actor is the aggregate of its members'
opinions).

**Disputes settle to ⊤, honestly (principle 6).** Conflict-resolution needs a way to *hold* a dispute
before resolving it. TAB has it: a contested claim — two parties both asserting a resource is theirs,
a sanction one faction levies and another denies — settles to ⊤ in `value.mjs` ("held both ways"), the
same value `socialize` already uses for an `ambivalent` relationship. Proposal: a dispute is a cell at
⊤, rendered as a dispute (not silently resolved to one side), and a conflict-resolution move
(arbitration, vote, ordeal) is what *lowers* it to t or f. The world models the impasse as content,
which is the precondition for a *fair, visible* resolution rather than a hidden tiebreak.

**The whole loop, as an equilibrium.** Put together: a resource is governed by a faction (boundary);
drawing on it costs in proportion to benefit (proportionality); every draw is logged and ambiently
witnessed (monitoring); over-drawing accrues negative opinion that escalates from a cooler stance to
refused trade to exclusion (graduated sanctions); disputes hold at ⊤ until an arbitration move settles
them (conflict resolution); and all of this is appends to a public log changeable by faction members
(collective choice, local autonomy, nesting). No step is a scripted "cooperate" command. Each is an
incentive that makes drawing-down-the-commons *cost the drawer their reputation and their future
access* — so a self-interested actor, in an indefinitely repeated world of recognizable partners,
cooperates because it pays. That is Ostrom's finding rendered as TAB systems, and it is the answer to
the tragedy `decide` ships with.

## Trust without a center: federation

Federation removes the one thing Hardin's *other* escape — central state coercion — depends on. There
is no central server: `federate` (`being/doing/federating/scripts/federate.mjs`) merges worlds by a
G-Set union of content-addressed logs, so two instances share entities with the same SHA-256 and a
player crosses servers by their log being sent as a message, with no authority transferring them. This
makes Hardin's "mutual coercion, mutually agreed upon" unavailable — there is no coercer. Governance in
a federated TAB *must* be the Ostrom kind (self-organized, reputation-and-sanction based) because the
Hardin kind is structurally absent. The companion note's point recurs: with no enforcer, no agreement
is binding in the cooperative-game sense, so the only stable cooperation is the self-enforcing kind.

**Reputation is the trust primitive, and it is portable.** Because identity is a content-address and
the log travels with the entity, an actor's *reputation travels with it across servers* — the negative
opinions earned for over-drawing on one instance arrive, by G-Set union, on the next. Proposal: this is
trust-without-a-center done right — no central reputation server, yet a portable, tamper-evident
history (content-addressing makes the log's rows verifiable; you cannot forge a row's hash). A
newcomer with a thin log is, correctly, an unknown quantity (its fiber is mostly ⊥ — honest ignorance,
not a clean slate to exploit).

**The Sybil problem is the boundary the design must hold.** Distributed reputation has one structural
attack: identity is cheap, so a defector can abandon a sullied identity and mint a fresh one (a Sybil),
shedding its negative history. TAB does not escape this for free — a content-address is mintable. The
defence is the one the literature points to: make reputation attach to *history-bearing* identities, so
that a clean log is worth *less* than an established one. Proposal: trust should weight an actor's
*accrued, witnessed history* (a long log of honored trades and cooperative draws), so that a fresh
identity carries no positive reputation to spend — abandoning a sullied log means abandoning all the
trust it earned. Combined with Ostrom's boundary principle (faction membership is gated, not open),
this makes the Sybil's fresh start a *cost*, not an escape: the over-drawer who flees its reputation
arrives everywhere as a stranger with nothing to trade on. This is a design constraint, not a built
feature — flagged here as the open governance problem federation introduces, and the place where the
trust-without-a-center design earns or loses its stability.
