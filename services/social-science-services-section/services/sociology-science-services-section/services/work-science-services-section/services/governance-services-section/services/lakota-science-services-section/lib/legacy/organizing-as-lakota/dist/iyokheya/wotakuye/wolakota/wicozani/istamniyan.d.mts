/**
 * istamniyan — the wiping-of-tears, the quiescence-restoration morphism (Ištámniyaŋ
 * Wičhákičhipakiŋtapi), at the wičhózani (settling) tier.
 *
 * Corpus: content/_archive/existence/lakota/.../wiping-of-tears-as-polity-quiescence-
 * restoration. A loss (a death, or a collective loss at polity scale) produces two
 * substrate disturbances that put the bereaved out of wičhózani: a persistent ⊤ on the
 * grief-cell (the kin-relation is real — the tie does not vanish at death — yet also
 * broken, since the deceased is no longer in the lived populace), and a persistent ⊥ on
 * cells the death has unsettled (who now speaks for what they spoke for, carries what they
 * carried).
 *
 * The wiping-of-tears morphism — performed about a year after the loss — resolves both. It
 * does NOT erase the loss and does NOT negate the relation: it RE-CLASSIFIES. The
 * lived-relation cell settles at f (the deceased is no longer in the lived populace) and a
 * NEW ancestor-relation cell settles at t — both consistently, so the ⊤ contradiction is
 * resolved into a determinate, wakȟáŋ-marked ancestor-relation that persists forever
 * (sustained thereafter by wanáǧi yuhápi). The unsettled ⊥ cells are reassigned and
 * witnessed. The aggregate effect is the return to wičhózani.
 *
 * This is RESTORATIVE governance, not punitive: a punitive operation installs
 * liable-for / sanction / confinement cells; this installs relation-repaired /
 * re-integration cells — different cells, different closure-subsystem. The polity repairs
 * its relational structure across loss WITHOUT a punitive apparatus. lakotaTerm:
 * "Ištámniyaŋ Wičhákičhipakiŋtapi".
