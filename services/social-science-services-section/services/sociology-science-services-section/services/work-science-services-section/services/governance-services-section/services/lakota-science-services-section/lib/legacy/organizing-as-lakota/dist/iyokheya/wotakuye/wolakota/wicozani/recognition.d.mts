/**
 * recognition — office-recognition as bigraded common knowledge, wičhózani tier.
 *
 * Corpus: content/_archive/existence/lakota/.../recognition-as-bigraded-common-knowledge.
 * A Lakota office (naca, akicita, wičháša wakȟáŋ, blotáhuŋka, heyókȟa) is recognized only
 * when its recognition is BIGRADED COMMON KNOWLEDGE — common knowledge in BOTH the
 * truth-axis Cᵗ and the knowledge-axis Cᵏ, the two independent greatest-fixed-point
 * common-knowledge operators of the bigraded-common-knowledge theorem. The two are not
 * collapsible: Cᵗ bottoms at f (no consensus-truth), Cᵏ bottoms at ⊥ (no
 * knowledge-aggregation).
 *
 *   - Cᵗ: the populace's collective affirmation — every member recognizes the incumbent,
 *     and every member knows every member does, ad infinitum.
 *   - Cᵏ: the populace's settled knowledge — everyone knows the office-state at the
 *     knowledge-top, recursively (the question has been substrate-settled as known).
 *
 * The offices are SUBSTRATE-EMERGENT: they exist when and only when the bigraded structure
 * holds across the populace — not maintained as a Western official-list. The operational
 * consequence is the polity's natural defense against usurpation: a claim to office
 * WITHOUT bigraded backing CANNOT FIRE the office's authority-cells, even if every
 * procedural step was followed. When the two axes diverge, the divergence itself diagnoses
 * the office's state (Cᵗ-only = affirmed but informationally unstable; Cᵏ-only =
 * procedurally-in-place but substantively-failed; neither = substrate-emergency).
 * lakotaTerm: "wówičada" (recognition).
