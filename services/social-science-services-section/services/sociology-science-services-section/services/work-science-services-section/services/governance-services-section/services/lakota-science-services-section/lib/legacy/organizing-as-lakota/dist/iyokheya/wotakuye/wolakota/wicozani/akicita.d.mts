/**
 * akicita — the camp-marshal band of bounded scope (Akíčhita), at the wičhózani tier.
 *
 * Corpus: content/_archive/existence/lakota/.../lakotaean-governance/.../akicita-band.
 * The akicita is the polity's primary mechanism for SCOPE-BOUNDED coercive coordination
 * — the hunt, the migration, the camp-circle at the sun dance, a war party. Its defining
 * structural feature is AUTOMATIC REVOCATION AT SCOPE-COMPLETION: the band is constituted
 * over a specific named scope-action X with a clear completion-condition; while X is in
 * progress its `scope-active` and `enforcement-authority` cells stand at t; when X
 * completes both fall to ⊥. Even its sanctions are scoped — a person sanctioned during
 * the hunt carries the sanction-cell ONLY over the hunt-scope; once the hunt completes,
 * the cell drops. There is no carry-over, no criminal-record-cell.
 *
 * This is NOT police. The absence is constitutive: 𝒮_wolak contains a closure-rule-class
 * for akicita-authority but NO closure-rule-class for standing-police-authority — no
 * open-ended jurisdiction, no standing force between scopes. The retraction at
 * scope-completion is a ≤ₖ-DECREASING transition (t → ⊥), admissible because these are
 * scoped cells: scope-completion is not retraction-of-information but completion of the
 * interpretive window. lakotaTerm: "Akíčhita".
