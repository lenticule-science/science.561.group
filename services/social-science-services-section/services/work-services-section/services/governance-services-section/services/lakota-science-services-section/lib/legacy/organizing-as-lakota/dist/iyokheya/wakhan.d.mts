 * wakhan — the wakȟáŋ cell-quality, and Wakȟáŋ Tȟáŋka the global pattern.
 *
 * lakotaTerm: wakȟáŋ ("sacred"), Wakȟáŋ Tȟáŋka ("the Great Sacred")
 *
 * Wakȟáŋ is a QUALITY a cell or rule carries when properly attended — not a separate
 * region or entity (translating Wakȟáŋ Tȟáŋka as a Christian-style God was always a
 * mistranslation). It is a marking w : Cells → {0,1}; a cell may be wakȟáŋ at any of
 * the four charges (a sacred relation held t, negated f, unsettled ⊥, or under
 * contradiction ⊤ — the signature of an attack on the sacred). The substrate enforces
 * a purity discipline: ordinary rules cannot fire on wakȟáŋ-marked cells.
 *
 * The aspect of the sacred a mark bears is read off tobtob-kin's bijection charge ≅
 * Wakȟáŋ (./tobtob-kin/tobtob-kin.mjs), not asserted. The full closure-rule purity
 * discipline is built at the lifeway tier (wólakȟota); this is the quality itself.
