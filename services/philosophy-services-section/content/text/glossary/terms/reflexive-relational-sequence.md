- [[define]]:: The [[reflexive relational sequence]] is the minimal [[structure]] induced by the act of [[reflecting]]. It is a recursively ordered series where each [[relational structure]] is brought into [[relation]] with itself, generating a new [[relational structure]] at the next [[reflexive position]].

## Derivation

- The act of [[reflecting]] relates any [[relational structure]] `S` to itself:
  
  - `reflect(S) := relating(S, S)`.
  
- This produces a new [[relational structure]] one step deeper in [[reflexive position]].

- Recursively, this induces:

    - `R(0) := S` (a base [[relational structure]]);
    - `R(1) := reflect(R(0))`;
    - `R(2) := reflect(R(1))`;
    - ...
    - `R(n+1) := reflect(R(n))`.

- Each `R(n)`:

    - retains the same ontological type,
    - embeds its predecessor,
    - and marks a distinct [[reflexive position]].

- The sequence is infinite, ensuring the system is closed under [[reflexivity]] and sustains depth-wise coherence.

- The [[condition]] of [[reflexive position]] differentiates each term in the sequence, maintaining ordered positionality across reflexive depths.
