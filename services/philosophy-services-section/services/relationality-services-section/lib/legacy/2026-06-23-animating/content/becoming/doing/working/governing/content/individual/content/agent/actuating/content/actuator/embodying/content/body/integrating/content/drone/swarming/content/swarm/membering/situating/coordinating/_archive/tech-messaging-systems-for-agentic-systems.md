For a distributed heterogeneous agentic system at nation-scale, message-passing is the primary concern: how do agents coordinate when they run in different processes, at different times, under different models, across different sites?
Real-world messaging systems have solved slices of this problem.
Each brings a pattern the 561 system can adopt.

## Apache Kafka — log-based messaging

Kafka stores messages as an **append-only log partitioned across brokers**.
Producers write to topics; consumers read by offset, replay at will.
The log IS the state — downstream systems derive their view by consuming the log from offset 0.
Retention is time-bounded (hours to forever).
Ordering is guaranteed within a partition, not across.

**Pattern:** event-log-as-source-of-truth.
Derived state is always rebuildable from replaying the log.
561's `events.jsonl` already implements this pattern in miniature — one JSONL file as the append-only log, knowledge graph as derived view.

**Applicable:** the entire EAVT graph is Kafka-style: knowledge-graph.json is consumers' materialized view of events.jsonl.
Multi-log partitioning could enable per-channel append-only files (plans-log, terms-log, decisions-log) without a single contention point.

## NATS — subject-based pub/sub

NATS is a lightweight broker with **hierarchical subjects** (`agents.researcher.dispatched`) and wildcard subscriptions (`agents.*.dispatched`).
Messages are typed by subject; subscribers express interest via subject patterns.
Default delivery is at-most-once (fast, no persistence); JetStream adds durable streams.

**Pattern:** hierarchical channel naming + subscriber-pattern matching.
Channels form a tree; subscriptions are cut-patterns on the tree.

**Applicable:** 561's implicit channels (bridge, fleet, engineering, failures) could be expressed as NATS-style subjects (`ops.planning.dispatched`, `ops.engineering.failed`).
Office subscriptions could be declared as patterns, making subscription routing mechanical.

## RabbitMQ — AMQP exchanges and routing

RabbitMQ decouples publishers from queues via **exchanges**: publishers send to an exchange, which routes to queues by type (fanout, direct, topic, headers).
Consumers bind queues to exchanges with routing keys.
Messages acknowledge explicitly; rejected messages retry or dead-letter.

**Pattern:** routing as a first-class concern, separate from delivery.
A message's destination is computed from its routing-key + exchange-binding, not baked into the message.

**Applicable:** 561's dispatch-routing is currently implicit (first-officer computes which office matches a task).
An AMQP-style exchange would make routing rules explicit and queryable — task.requires routes through a binding that selects offices, rather than inference.

## ActivityPub — federated social messaging

ActivityPub uses **HTTP POST to each actor's `inbox`**, with actor profiles served at stable URLs.
Activities (`Create`, `Follow`, `Like`, `Announce`) are typed JSON-LD objects.
Federation works via HTTP signatures: server A delivers to server B by signing and POST-ing.
No central authority.
Each server maintains its own state; federation is eventually consistent.

**Pattern:** federation through typed HTTP endpoints with cryptographic provenance.
Each participant is sovereign; federation is optional and asymmetric (you can follow without being followed back).

**Applicable:** 561's deployment model (infrastructure for Black Liberation + Indigenous Sovereignty) requires federation without central authority.
ActivityPub's inbox/outbox pattern maps directly: each 561 instance serves its own records, federates selectively with allied instances, signs deliveries with instance keys.
The `activitypub.md` idea file in triage already sketches this.

## Matrix — federated eventual-consistency event graphs

Matrix treats rooms as **directed acyclic graphs of events**.
Each event references its parents; the DAG is gossipped across federating servers.
State is computed by resolving the DAG (state-resolution algorithm v2).
End-to-end encryption (Olm/Megolm) is first-class.
Federation is many-to-many, not hub-and-spoke.

**Pattern:** state-as-DAG-fold.
The room state at any point is the fold over all events up to that point.
Concurrent edits resolve deterministically via canonical ordering.

**Applicable:** 561's events.jsonl is linear; Matrix's event-DAG handles concurrent writes from multiple agents/sessions.
If two officers append to the same channel simultaneously, Matrix's model gives a canonical resolution.
For a future where FARS instances federate, event-DAG + state-resolution is a proven pattern.

## Erlang/OTP — actor model with supervision

Erlang processes are **isolated, communicate only via asynchronous message-passing**.
Each process has a mailbox; `receive` pattern-matches on incoming messages.
Supervisor trees restart failed processes ("let it crash").
Distribution is transparent — a message to a process on another node uses the same syntax as local.

**Pattern:** isolation + asynchronous message-passing as fault-tolerance mechanism.
Failures are contained to a single actor; the supervisor decides restart policy.

**Applicable:** 561 officers are actors — each session is an isolated process with its own context, communicating via messages (dispatch prompts, event records, return values).
Supervisor hierarchy is the dispatch chain (first-officer supervises crew; captain supervises first-officer).
Let-it-crash applies: failed sessions don't corrupt the shared state because all state flows through the event log.

## IPFS / libp2p — content-addressed pubsub

IPFS identifies every object by **content hash (CID)**.
The same content has the same address everywhere.
Objects are distributed via DHT; pubsub (GossipSub) flood-propagates messages across peers subscribing to the same topic.
No central server, no global ordering.

**Pattern:** content-addressing + gossip-based pubsub.
Identity is derived from content, not assigned; subscribers receive from peers, not a broker.

**Applicable:** 561's `project_capability-composition-insight.md` already flagged content-addressing (canonical triple-set hash) as the path to stable entity identity.
IPFS-style CIDs for messages would make cross-instance federation trivial: two 561 instances citing the same message refer to the same CID, regardless of which instance originated it.

## Event sourcing (Greg Young, 2010) — pattern, not system

Event sourcing stores **every state change as an event**, deriving current state by replaying events.
No update-in-place.
Queries run against a projected view (materialized from event fold).
The event log is the source of truth; projections are caches.

**Pattern:** mutation = append new event; state = fold of event log.
Enables time-travel debugging, audit trails, replay-for-testing.

**Applicable:** 561 already uses this shape.
Making it complete means: every record creation/mutation MUST produce an event; the knowledge graph MUST be regeneratable from the event log alone; invariants become assertions on folds.

## CRDTs (Shapiro et al., 2011) — conflict-free replicated data types

CRDTs are data structures where **concurrent updates merge deterministically without coordination**.
State-based CRDTs (G-Counter, OR-Set, LWW-Register, RGA) have mathematical join operations; operation-based CRDTs broadcast commutative ops.
Two replicas converging eventually see the same state.

**Pattern:** merge as a categorical operation (commutative, associative, idempotent).
No consensus protocol needed.

**Applicable:** when two officers edit the same record concurrently (or two FARS instances federate), CRDT merge rules would resolve conflicts without a lock.
A task's `status:` could be a LWW-Register; a task's `depends-on:` could be an OR-Set.
CRDTs turn eventual consistency into a correctness property.

## Synthesis — which patterns apply to 561

| Pattern | System | 561 application |
|---|---|---|
| event-log as source of truth | Kafka, event sourcing | already in events.jsonl; generalize to per-channel logs |
| hierarchical subjects + pattern subscriptions | NATS | formalize channels as a tree; subscriptions as patterns |
| content-addressed identity | IPFS | canonical triple-hash for message/entity IDs (captain has flagged this) |
| federated HTTP actors with signed delivery | ActivityPub | deployment model for instance-to-instance federation |
| event-DAG with state-resolution | Matrix | concurrent-write resolution when officers/instances race |
| actor model with supervision | Erlang/OTP | officers as isolated actors; dispatch as supervision |
| CRDT merge semantics | CRDTs | concurrent-edit resolution without locks |
| routing rules as first-class records | RabbitMQ/AMQP | dispatch-routing bindings, not inference |

The 561 system does not need ONE of these — it needs a stack where each solves a distinct problem:

- **Kafka-pattern** for the internal append-only message substrate (already half-built)
- **IPFS-pattern** for cross-instance message identity (content-addressed)
- **ActivityPub-pattern** for instance-to-instance federation
- **Erlang-pattern** for session-as-actor with supervised dispatch
- **CRDT-pattern** for federation merge semantics
- **Event-sourcing-pattern** as the unifying philosophy (state is the fold of the log)

**What's missing from the patterns:** provenance-at-message-level for accountability-through-delegation.
A message from an officer must carry the chain of authority that authorized its sending.
Closest analogs: Matrix's event-signatures, ActivityPub's HTTP signatures.
Neither carries **authority-provenance** (the delegation-chain) alongside identity-provenance (who signed).
The 561 system's governance-theoretic grounding (office, delegation, authority) requires extending message envelopes with a delegation-chain field — this appears to be a novel requirement emerging from the 561 context.
