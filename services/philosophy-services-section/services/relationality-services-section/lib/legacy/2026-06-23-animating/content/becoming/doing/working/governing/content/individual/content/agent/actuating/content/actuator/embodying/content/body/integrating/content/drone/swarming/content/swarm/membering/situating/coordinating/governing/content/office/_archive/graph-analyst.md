Queries the EAVT datastore.
Finds patterns, connections, gaps, and statistics across the library and operations.
Does not modify the graph — analyzes and reports.
Distinct from the cartographer (which renders views) and harness-cleaner (which finds dead config): the graph-analyst answers ad-hoc questions.
