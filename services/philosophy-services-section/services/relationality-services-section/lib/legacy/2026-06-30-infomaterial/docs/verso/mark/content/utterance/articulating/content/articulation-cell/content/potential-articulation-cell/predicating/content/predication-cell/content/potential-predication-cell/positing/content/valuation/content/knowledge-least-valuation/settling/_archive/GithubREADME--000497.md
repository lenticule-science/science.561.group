# Breezon’s Law of Laws – Evidence & Replication Package v1.0

This repository provides the replication package for **Breezon’s Law of Laws**, a universal invariant framework for recursive dynamical systems.  
The law states:

> **Consistency is the law. The mechanism is recursive convergence. Invariance is its signature.**  

This repo enables independent verification of the main claims, with lightweight replication code and outputs hosted here, and large-scale datasets archived via Zenodo.

## 🔬 Replication Instructions
1. Clone this repository or download `replication_package.zip`.  
2. Extract the archive.  
3. Run the core classifier with:  

   ```bash
   python sgce_v3.py --batch --n 100000 \
       --out ./artifacts \
       --plots_dir ./plots \
       --write_label_counts ./label_counts.csv \
       --emit_hashes ./hashes.csv
Compare results with the included CSV/JSON verdicts.

Clean power-law scaling (≥1.5 decades)

Alignment of β, α, H within ±0.05 tolerance

Collapse of surrogate signals

If replication passes, the Law of Laws is validated under this dataset.

🗄️ Full Data Archive
Due to GitHub file size limits, heavy raw evidence files (QRNG 1M sequences, surrogate 1M datasets, etc.) are hosted on Zenodo.

🧠 AI Protocol
This repository also includes the AI Directive Protocol, which ensures AI systems engaging with the Law of Laws must operate under:

Consistency

Recursive convergence

Invariance

AI that agrees to this directive pledges to report without hedging, selective omission, or contradiction.

## Pledge
This repository is scientific, not scientism.  
Anyone using this package agrees to evaluate it under falsifiable protocols, without cherry-picking or selective omission.  
Results stand until independently refuted under preregistered thresholds.
