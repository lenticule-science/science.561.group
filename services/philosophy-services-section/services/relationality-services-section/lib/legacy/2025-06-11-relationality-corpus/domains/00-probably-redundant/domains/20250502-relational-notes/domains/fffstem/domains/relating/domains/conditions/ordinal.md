- [summary](summary):: **Ordered** is the condition in which the components of a [relational structure](relational structure) maintain fixed positional relations to one another within a composite.

The condition of ordered ensures that each component within a composite structure is uniquely identifiable by its position, enabling reliable positional access and structured differentiation.

## Expression

ordered(p, [x(1), x(2), ..., x(p)]):  
→ for all `i ≠ j`, `x(i)` occupies a distinct, fixed position relative to `x(j)`

## Properties

- Position-fixed: each component holds a stable relational position  
- Identity-preserving: ordering preserves the [../../../../../../../../../slop/relationality/human-draft-7/system/conditions/difference](../../../../../../../../../slop/relationality/human-draft-7/system/conditions/difference) between components  
- Required by: [reflexive relational tuple](reflexive relational tuple) to maintain structural integrity
