- Definition:: ***reflecting an induced relation*** is the [act](act) of inducing a [relational structure](relational structure) formed from multiple [reflex induced relation|reflexed induced relations](reflex induced relation|reflexed induced relations) at a shared reflexive iteration.

## Derivation
- [postulate](postulate):: If [reflex induced relation|reflexing an induced relation](reflex induced relation|reflexing an induced relation)(n) derives from an act that includes itself, it cannot not [induce](induce) a [relation](./relation.md) between multiple such reflexed induced relations, forming a relational structure across reflexive acts.
- [derivation](derivation):: Reflecting p reflex-induced relations at reflexive iteration n induces a relational composition that cannot not be ordered. As each reflex relates recursively to itself, their composition reflects the order of their generation, inducing structured depth.
- example:
	- reflect(0, n) = reflex(reflex(n−1))
	- reflect(1, n) = reflex(reflect(0, n−1))
	- reflect(p, n) = reflex(reflect(p−1, n)) for p ≥ 2
- [relational expression](relational expression):: [reflect induced relation|reflect-induced-relation](reflect induced relation|reflect-induced-relation)(p, n) is [reflex induced relation|reflex-induced-relation](reflex induced relation|reflex-induced-relation)(reflect-induced-relation(p-1, n)) where p and n are any independent non-negative integers
## Formalism
- As [reflex induced relation|reflex-induced-relation](reflex induced relation|reflex-induced-relation) is derived:
	- reflex-induced-relation(0) = induce(relationlessness, relation)
	- reflex-induced-relation(n) = reflex-induced-relation(reflex-induced-relation(n-1))
- Define reflect-induced-relation as the form of p reflex-induced relations at reflexive iteration n, where p and n are independent non-negative integers.
- Then:
	- reflect-induced-relation(0, n) = reflex-induced-relation(reflex-induced-relation(n-1))
	- reflect-induced-relation(1, n) = reflex-induced-relation(reflect-induced-relation(0, n-1))
	- reflect-induced-relation(p, n) = reflex-induced-relation(reflect-induced-relation(p-1, n)) for p
- Thus:
	- reflect-induced-relation(p, n) = reflex-induced-relation(reflect-induced-relation(p, 1, n)) for p  ≥ 2
