description: The ethics of engagement — the compulsion-loop / Skinner-box / dark-pattern literature (variable-ratio reinforcement, Schüll's "machine zone," loot boxes, engagement-vs-well-being) set against an autonomy-supportive, honest-world design ethic, and the POSITION that tab's substrate makes the ethical path structurally natural. The world is a deterministic, inspectable, replayable/forkable log with no hidden state and ⊥ = honest ignorance, so the manipulation mechanisms (hidden RNG, concealed state, dependence-by-design, the player who can't leave) are largely unbuildable on it. FACTS from the critique kept apart from tab PROPOSALS and the stated tab stance.

# The ethics of engagement

`player-motivation` reads the *constructive* engagement literature — SDT, flow, Yee, presence —
and maps the three needs onto tab morphisms. This note reads the *critical* literature: the study
of how engagement is manufactured against the player's interest, and the ethical line between
*supporting* a need and *exploiting* it. Then it takes a position. Rigby & Ryan themselves draw
this line — the same SDT lens that explains healthy engagement explains the unhealthy kind, as a
*substitute* satisfaction that displaces real need-fulfilment (Rigby & Ryan, *Glued to Games*,
2011) — so the ethics is not a foreign import; it is the other half of the motivation theory.

As in the companion note, **theory-facts** (what the critique found) are kept apart from
**tab-proposals** and from the **tab stance** (the position I argue for tab). The stance is mine.

## Theory: how engagement is manufactured against the player

### Operant conditioning and the variable-ratio schedule

**Fact.** Skinner's operant conditioning showed that the *schedule* of reinforcement governs
behaviour, and that the **variable-ratio schedule** — a reward delivered after an unpredictable
number of responses — produces the highest, most persistent, most extinction-resistant rate of
responding of any schedule (Skinner, *Schedules of Reinforcement*, Ferster & Skinner, 1957). The
slot machine is the canonical variable-ratio device, and "Skinner-box" mechanics is the term of art
for game systems that borrow it: randomised rewards on an unpredictable schedule (drops, gacha,
loot boxes) engineered to keep the response going regardless of the player's stated goals.

### Schüll's "machine zone" — design for dissociation

**Fact.** Natasha Dow Schüll's *Addiction by Design: Machine Gambling in Las Vegas* (Princeton UP,
2012), drawing on fifteen years of field research, documents how electronic gambling machines are
*deliberately engineered* to pull players into the **"machine zone"** — a trancelike state in
which time, money, social demands, and bodily awareness dissolve. The design goal is not the win
but **time-on-device**: once in the zone "gambling addicts play not to win but simply to keep
playing … even at the cost of physical and economic exhaustion." Schüll's key analytic move,
borrowing Winnicott, is **perfect contingency** — complete alignment between an action and the
machine's immediate response — which makes the zone possible. The ethical charge is that the
industry's metric (continuous time-on-device, "player productivity") is *structurally opposed* to
the player's welfare: the machine is optimised to extract, not to serve.

### Compulsion loops, retention metrics, and engagement ≠ well-being

**Fact.** The free-to-play industry organises design around the **compulsion loop** (or core
engagement loop): a short cycle of anticipation → action → reward → reinvestment, tuned to keep the
player cycling, and measured by **retention** (D1/D7/D30 return rates), **session length**, and
**daily active users** — proxies for time and spend, not for whether the time was well spent.
**Fact.** Rigby & Ryan distinguish *engagement* from *well-being* directly: a game can be highly
engaging (need-satisfying in the moment) while leaving the player *worse off* afterward, when the
engagement is a thin substitute — obsessive passion rather than harmonious passion — that crowds
out the autonomy it superficially supplies (Rigby & Ryan, 2011). A retention metric cannot tell the
two apart; it counts the return, not the reason.

### Dark patterns in game design

**Fact.** Zagal, Björk & Lewis ("Dark Patterns in the Design of Games," *Foundations of Digital
Games* 2013, 39–46) name and catalogue **dark game design patterns** — patterns "used
intentionally by a game creator to cause negative experiences for players which are against their
best interests and likely to happen without their consent." Their catalogue includes **grinding**
(repeated tedious tasks that "cheat" the player out of their time), **appointment mechanics**
(designs exploiting loss-aversion so the player must return on the game's schedule or lose
progress — FarmVille's withering crops), **pay-to-skip / pay-to-win**, and **playing-by-appointment
/ social-pyramid** schemes that conscript the player's friends. The common thread is a **conflict
of interest** between creator and player resolved in the creator's favour, often via *concealment*
(the player cannot see the mechanism acting on them).

### Loot boxes — the convergence with gambling

**Fact.** Zendle & Cairns ("Video game loot boxes are linked to problem gambling: Results of a
large-scale survey," *PLOS ONE* 13(11), 2018, n = 7,422) found that the amount spent on loot boxes
correlated with **problem-gambling severity**, and more strongly than spending on non-randomised
in-game items — implicating the *gambling-like (variable-ratio, concealed-odds) feature itself*,
not merely microtransaction spending. Replications and adolescent samples reproduced the link. This
is the variable-ratio schedule, monetised, with the odds hidden — the Skinner box and Schüll's
machine fused into a game mechanic.

### The synthesis the critique points to

**Fact / synthesis.** Across these sources the *mechanisms* of exploitative engagement share four
structural ingredients:

1. **Hidden randomness** — a variable-ratio schedule whose odds the player cannot see (loot-box
   drop rates, slot RNG).
2. **Concealed state** — the system knows things about the player and the world the player cannot
   inspect (pity timers, difficulty rubber-banding, A/B-tested hooks, spend-based targeting).
3. **Dependence by design** — appointment mechanics and loss-aversion that make *leaving* costly,
   so the loop runs on the game's schedule, not the player's.
4. **A metric opposed to the player** — time-on-device / retention / spend as the optimisation
   target, structurally indifferent to whether the player is better off.

These four are the inverse of an *autonomy-supportive* design: one that gives the player genuine
volition, full information, and the freedom to stop. That inversion is the hinge of the position
below.

## tab stance: an honest world, and why the substrate makes it natural

This is the position. **tab should adopt, as a deliberate design ethic, the autonomy-supportive,
honest-world stance: the world is deterministic, inspectable, and replayable/forkable; the player
is supported in their volition, never manipulated; and the player can always leave, replay, or
fork.** I argue not only that tab *should* do this but that tab's substrate makes the ethical path
the *structurally natural* one — the four exploitative ingredients above are largely *unbuildable*
on it, or buildable only by fighting the grain. I take the four ingredients in turn and show what
tab's existing properties do to each.

### 1. Hidden randomness ↔ tab has no hidden RNG; the world is deterministic

**Proposal.** The self-running world is built from "deterministic functions of state — no RNG, no
LLM" (`the-self-running-world`), and "the same log produces the same future." A variable-ratio
schedule with concealed odds — the engine of the Skinner box and the loot box — has *nowhere to
live* in a world whose every transition is a deterministic fold of a public log. Even when tab
adds indeterminacy, it does so as **non-confluence** — a genuine fork in the settlement geometry
whose alternative branches are *real and enumerable* ("the forks are REAL — the alternative
branches exist as bypass cones," `non-confluence-is-choice`), not a hidden weighted die. tab's form
of chance is an *inspectable* fork, not a concealed schedule. The ingredient most central to
manufactured compulsion is the one tab structurally lacks.

### 2. Concealed state ↔ tab has no hidden state; ⊥ is honest ignorance, ⊤ is shown

**Proposal.** This is the deepest structural alignment. The exploitative pattern *depends* on the
system knowing more than it shows — pity timers, spend-targeting, rubber-banding. tab's substrate
forbids the asymmetry in two ways already noted:

- **The world IS the append-only log** (`the-self-running-world`, `history-is-geometric`): there is
  no separate hidden game state to conceal, because state is just `fold(log)` over content-addressed
  rows. What the engine "knows" is what the log says, and the log is the world.
- **The two honest corners of the bilattice.** `perception-as-umwelt-filter` and `ludics-grounding`
  record that **⊥ means honest ignorance** ("not yet experienced (unknown)") and **⊤ is *shown*,
  not hidden** ("the SHP carries each cell's glyph so ⊤ situations are visible, not hidden"; "the
  renderer never invents: every line is a settled predication"). A system whose model of *not
  knowing* is a first-class displayed value, and whose model of *contradiction* is a displayed
  value rather than a silently-picked side, cannot easily run the concealment the dark pattern
  needs. The engine that says "⊥, I don't know" out loud is constitutionally bad at hiding a pity
  timer.

The one honest asymmetry that *does* exist — that an actor's private cuts stay private until
perceived (the Umwelt frontier) — is asymmetry *between players in the fiction*, not between the
engine and the player. The engine conceals nothing from the player about how the world works; it
only models that your character hasn't seen the harbormaster's private act yet. That is *diegetic*
limited perception (good — it is presence and discovery), not *operant* concealment (the dark
pattern). The distinction is the whole ethic: hide things *in the world* from a character, never
hide *the world's mechanism* from the person.

### 3. Dependence by design ↔ the player can always leave, replay, or fork

**Proposal.** Appointment mechanics make *leaving* costly; the honest-world ethic makes leaving
free. tab's substrate makes leaving-and-returning *lossless* by construction:

- **Replayable.** "The same log produces the same future"; `--replay` re-folds the whole world and
  "gets the same answer" (`the-self-running-world`). A player can leave and the world they left is
  exactly recoverable — there is no FOMO-able perishable state, because nothing perishes; the log
  keeps everything.
- **Forkable.** `next-gen-engine-architecture` makes "forkable, replayable, diffable timelines" a
  Layer-0 consequence: "save-scumming *as an engine feature*, for free." A player who dislikes where
  a session went can fork the timeline and try again. The mechanic that dark patterns weaponise
  (loss aversion over a single fragile timeline) is *defused* when timelines are cheap, branchable,
  and the past is never destroyed.
- **The world runs without the player.** `the-self-running-world` and `the-self-running-world`'s
  tick advance the world "with or without the player." A world that does not *need* you online to
  keep existing is one that has no incentive to trap you online — the appointment mechanic's entire
  premise (the world decays unless you tend it on schedule) is absent because the world is a tick
  over a log, not a stake the engine holds hostage.

### 4. A metric opposed to the player ↔ tab optimises for an honest story, not time-on-device

**Stance (normative, mine).** The first three are structural — tab's substrate resists the
mechanisms. The fourth is a *choice*, and I argue tab should make it explicitly: **adopt no
retention/time-on-device/spend metric as a design target.** The substrate removes the
*mechanisms* of manufactured compulsion but does not, by itself, forbid a designer from *wanting*
one; that is a stance to state, not a property to inherit. The `next-gen-engine-architecture`
already names the *right* target — "a person … plays for an hour, and comes away with a *story they
could tell* — one nobody scripted." That is a well-being-shaped metric (did the time produce
something the player values?), the SDT-respectful inverse of time-on-device. The stance: tab's
success is measured by the *quality of the story the player leaves with*, explicitly **not** by how
long the engine kept them, and the engine should ship no machinery (no daily-login reward, no
energy timer, no streak, no concealed difficulty hook) whose only purpose is to lift a retention
number.

### Why the ethic is the *natural* path, not just the chosen one

**Synthesis (mine).** Map the four exploitative ingredients against tab's four substrate
properties and they cancel almost perfectly:

| exploitative ingredient | tab substrate property | result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| hidden variable-ratio RNG | deterministic fold; chance = inspectable non-confluence | no place to hide odds |
| concealed game state | world IS the public log; ⊥ honest, ⊤ shown | nothing the engine hides from the person |
| dependence by design | replayable + forkable + world runs without you | leaving is lossless; no FOMO to weaponise |
| retention-as-target | (a stance) story-you-can-tell as the metric | must be *chosen*, but nothing pulls against it |

Three of the four are *structural*: building the dark pattern means building *against* the
substrate — adding a hidden RNG to a deterministic world, a concealed state-store beside an
append-only log, a perishable hostage-stake into a replayable one. The substrate doesn't merely
*permit* the ethical design; it makes the unethical design the *harder, grain-fighting* one. And
this is the same property tab already prizes for other reasons — determinism for replay, the public
log for federation and crash-recovery, ⊥/⊤ for honest modelling. **The honest-world ethic is not a
constraint tab pays for; it falls out of the properties tab built for engineering reasons.** That
is the position: tab is, almost accidentally and then on purpose, an autonomy-supportive engine,
because an inspectable deterministic log is what a respectful world is *made of*.

## What is stance vs. what is structure

To keep the proposal honest about itself: three of the four protections are *structural*
(properties of the substrate as built — no hidden RNG, no hidden state, replayable/forkable) and
one is a *normative choice* (refusing retention metrics) that the substrate enables but does not
enforce. tab can still be designed unethically *on top of* an honest substrate — a designer could
bolt a manipulative reward schedule onto deterministic rows. The substrate makes that *hard and
against the grain*; the ethic makes it *forbidden*. Both are needed. This note records both, and
argues tab should state the stance plainly because the structure already leans that way.
