/**
 * English actions — the communicating cocone read over the English fiber, plus the
 * English-language CODEC surface.
 *
 * `actions(english)` from the base supplies communicating's ONE operation surface:
 * the meme endomorphisms (communicate, semiose, speak, listen, illocute, ground,
 * translate, negate, conflate, refer, modalize, presuppose, quote, compose). The
 * base no longer admits raw text as an operation — text↔meme is a codec boundary.
 *
 * `codecActions(english)` supplies the `decode_L` codec surface (decode-communication
 * / articulate-communication / settle-communication — the former core text actions
 * relocated to their proper home as a codec, read over the English bundle). This
 * package additionally adds the operation that only exists for a language with a
 * realized prose surface — English prose conformance. `induceBins` over this array is
 * the discovery apex the English `communicate` dispatcher and `communicate-serve` are
 * projected from.
