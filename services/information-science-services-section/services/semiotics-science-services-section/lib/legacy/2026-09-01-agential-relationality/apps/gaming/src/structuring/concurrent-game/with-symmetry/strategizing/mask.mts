/**
 * Masks — a participant's HANDEDNESS as the I/O FACE it turns to an arena.
 *
 * The corpus claim *embodied-handedness-is-player-opponent-duality*
 * (`concurrent-game-system.md:363-381`) is a theorem: an embodied participant's
 * four-tuple handedness $h(p) = (\mathrm{recv}, \mathrm{send}, \mathrm{actuate},
 * \mathrm{observe})$ IS Player/Opponent duality $(-)^\perp$ in $\mathbf{CGS}$. A
 * morphism $A \to B$ is a strategy on $A^\perp \| B$, and the four coordinates
 * partition by which side of that duality they sit on:
 *
 *   - `recv`, `observe` — **Opponent-side** on the input arena $A$ (the
 *     environment dictates; the participant receives);
 *   - `send`, `actuate` — **Player-side** on the output arena $B$ (the
 *     participant commits; the environment receives).
 *
 * This four-coordinate shape is a **MASK**: the face the agent turns to the arena —
 * what it shows outward (the Player side it commits) and what it takes in (the
 * Opponent side it receives). It is not a self; it carries no algebra and no
 * interior. There is no character "behind" it — the dramatic character is the
 * GLUING of an agent's masks (`@emsenn/playing`'s `identity` / `characterAgent`),
 * not a substance beneath them. A mask records one participant's four bounded
 * coordinates, partitioned by the $(-)^\perp$ side; `sides` exposes the
 * $A^\perp \| B$ split so a reader sees the morphism shape, and a *symmetric peer*
 * (the fixed point of the dual: `recv = send`, `observe = actuate`) is recorded as
 * the degenerate **copycat** — recorded, never imposed (`concurrent-game-system.md:379`,
 * "asymmetry is recorded, not refused").
 *
 * This module owns no composition: a Mask IS the *shape* of a morphism; the
 * composable 1-cell it realizes (copycat identity, interaction-plus-hiding) is
 * earned in `@emsenn/computing`, one layer up. Here we only record the face and
 * its polarity partition, reusing the game's own `Polarity` carrier — no second
 * encoding of duality.
