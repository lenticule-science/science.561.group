/**
 * gaming/market/arena — the market read as a concurrent game.
 *
 * Authority: `dev/docs/notes/2026-06-22-trading-as-settling-over-value-categories.md`
 * §4 stage 6 ("market = concurrent game"): *"The double auction / matching engine
 * = CGS with symmetry; Walras/Nash equilibrium = the settled game position; auctions
 * & mechanism design = arena construction. This is where the retired 'market-as-arena'
 * reading is revived honestly — markets are the canonical concurrent game, not a
 * vestigial admission stub."* And §7's prohibition: *"The one thing NOT to revive
 * as-is: the dead 'market read as a gaming `Arena`' stub (retired when the gaming-CGS
 * algebra changed). It is revived properly at §4 stage 6 on gaming's real CGS, or it
 * stays absent — never re-stubbed."*
 *
 * This module composes gaming's own primitives from the ground up:
 *
 *   - **events** (`event(id, polarity)`). One event per book-level slot plus one fill
 *     event per crossing (bid-level, ask-level) pair. Polarity is the corpus's
 *     P/O ↔ charge convention (`polarityCharge`): a resting **bid** and a resting
 *     **ask** are both `negative()` (Opponent — standing liquidity the market posts
 *     and may withdraw), and a **fill** is `positive()` (Proponent — the affirmative
 *     act that consumes liquidity, the "told-true" of a deal). This matches stage 6's
 *     reading of a fill as the cut-elimination (the affirmative settlement) of two
 *     resting designs.
 *   - **causality** (`['bid','fill']`, `['ask','fill']`). A fill RESTS ON a bid and
 *     an ask: an event may not occur until its causes have, so a `fill:i-j` cannot
 *     occur before its `bid:i` and its `ask:j`. This is the prime-event-structure
 *     reading of "a trade requires a resting buyer and a resting seller".
 *   - **conflict** (two fills of the same liquidity are mutually exclusive). Liquidity
 *     is non-copyable (the anti-fetishism / linearity law of stage 2): two fills that
 *     draw on the same bid level, or on the same ask level, are in CGS conflict (`#`)
 *     — they never both occur. This is the double-auction matching constraint stated
 *     as the event structure's conflict relation, not as imperative bookkeeping.
 *   - **symmetry** (`nominalArenaJudgment`). Participants are interchangeable: the
 *     order ids of one side are an FSym(𝔸) name set, and the nominal arena judgment
 *     adds the interchanging permutations to the arena's symmetry groupoid. Anonymity
 *     of orders (price-time priority modulo identity) IS nominal equivariance.
 *
 * The **equilibrium** is the settled game position (stage 6: *"Walras/Nash equilibrium
 * = the settled game position"*). It is `createGame → addDesign(bid) → addDesign(ask)
 * → settle`, REUSING the exchange layer's bid/ask `Design`s (stage 2's P/O designs) as
 * the enrolled designs. `settle` discriminates on `.kind` and returns an obstruction
 * carrier rather than throwing — fewer than two designs (an unmatchable book side)
 * settles to a `too-few-designs` obstruction, which is data, never an exception.
 *
 * Every verb is registered once as a relating `action` so `induceBins` projects the
 * whole surface to every transport. Carriers are gaming's own frozen carriers
 * (`Arena`, `PrimeEventStructure`, `SymmetryJudgment`, `Game`) — nothing new is
 * invented; the market is presented as the concurrent game it already is.
