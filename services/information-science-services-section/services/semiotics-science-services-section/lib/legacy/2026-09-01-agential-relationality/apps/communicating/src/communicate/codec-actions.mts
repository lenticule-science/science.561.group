/**
 * communicate/codec-actions — the text↔meme CODEC surface, parameterized over a
 * language bundle.
 *
 * This is NOT communicating's operation surface (that is `actions(bundle)`, the
 * meme-transforming morphisms and membrane readings). These are
 * the `decode_L` codec actions: the ONLY place raw text is admitted as an operation.
 * They are the former core text actions (read/articulate/settle) reclassified as a
 * codec boundary and relocated out of the core operation surface — their bodies are
 * the rich machinery the package still exports (read/projectReading/articulate/settle),
 * now read over a concrete language bundle.
 *
 * A `@emsenn/communicating-in-<language>` package spreads `codecActions(itsBundle)`
 * alongside `actions(itsBundle)` so its discovery apex exposes both the language-neutral
 * meme operations and the language's own decode codec. The core itself injects no
 * bundle, so it exposes no codec actions; the codec exists only where a language is.
