/**
 * Game — a running game IS a concurrent game system.
 *
 * Per the corpus, "the theory of computing is $\mathbf{CGS}$" (concurrent games
 * with symmetry): the unique $*$-autonomous category in which sequential game
 * semantics, nominal computation, session-typed concurrency, and realizability
 * all embed.  A running game is therefore not a new datatype — it is a
 * *configuration* of the carriers already proved in `@emsenn/gaming` and
 * `@emsenn/gaming`:
 *
 *   - an **arena** (a polarized prime event structure with symmetry groupoid) —
 *     the board;
 *   - the **designs** in play (Girard's dialogical objects, realized as charge
 *     valuations on the locus tree — "a design IS a partial valuation into the
 *     meme-algebra bilattice charge");
 *   - a current **play** (a secured linearization of the causal order — the
 *     position-with-history reached so far), advanced only by the one legal-move
 *     transition `extend`;
 *   - the interaction **history**: a log of moves and interactions, each
 *     interaction recording its `interactionReport` (the knowledge-join normal
 *     form) and whether it `converged` — reached the Daimon $\dagger$ ($\top$),
 *     i.e. orthogonality $\mathfrak{D} \perp \mathfrak{E}$.
 *
 * The transitions are pure: each returns a *new* frozen `Game`, or an
 * obstruction carrier (the witness/obstruction union pattern) when the move is
 * illegal.  Carriers are `Object.freeze`d plain objects with `kind:
 * "game.computer.<thing>"` discriminants.  Nothing is invented here: a `Game`
 * is wholly composed of earlier carriers.
 *
 * NOTE on shape: the listed `Game` fields are `{id, arena, designs, history}`;
 * we additionally carry the current `play: Play` (itself a game-algebra carrier)
 * so `playMove` can `extend` a tracked position rather than reconstruct it from
 * the interleaved history — faithful and cleaner, and still "nothing new
 * invented".
