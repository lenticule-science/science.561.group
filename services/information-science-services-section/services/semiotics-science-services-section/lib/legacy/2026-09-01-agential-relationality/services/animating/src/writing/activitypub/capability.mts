/**
 * writing/activitypub/capability — object-capabilities (OCapPub), realized through
 * the OUT (playing) face: ActivityPub as a concurrent game system.
 *
 * Christine Lemmer-Webber's OCapPub/Spritely arc reached for ActivityPub-as-a-
 * distributed-game with object-capabilities instead of identity. That vision is what
 * our OUT face already IS: `playing` is the *-autonomous concurrent-game system (the
 * `cut`/`interact` is interaction), `gaming` is its multi-agent FSym(𝔸) extension
 * (name-passing). So the OCap algebra falls out:
 *
 *   capability   = a LOCUS / design one may play at (playing) — a legal move
 *   invocation   = the CUT / interaction (playing's interaction normal form)
 *   delegation   = NAME-PASSING (gaming's FSym(𝔸) name mobility)
 *   attenuation  = DUALIZE / restriction (the *-autonomous structure)
 *
 * And the grounding is concrete, not analogy: the corpus defines the agent as a
 * perceive→act loop, and `act` already computes the agent's AFFORDANCES (the open
 * cells it may act on). A capability is an affordance reified as an unforgeable,
 * attenuable, delegable reference — and it is EXERCISABLE exactly when it names a
 * move the holder actually has (`canInvoke`). Authority is "what move can you play",
 * not "who are you". See dev/docs/notes/2026-06-25-codecs-on-faces-activitypub-across-scales.md.
