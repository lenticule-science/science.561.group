/**
 * actions — animating's registered operations, each a cocone leg over the relating
 * boundary.
 *
 * Every verb is registered once here as a relating `action` — a boundary morphism
 * with a declared domain/codomain. `induceBins` over this list (in the scripts)
 * assembles the discovery apex from which CLI/OpenAPI/MCP/web are projected by the
 * one relating dispatcher; this package invents no second transport. None of the
 * domain modules binds stdin or argv — the dispatcher owns that.
 *
 * The surface is the agency descent, made callable:
 *   - `animate` — the spine: a seed → the interior agent (the perceive→act loop).
 *   - `becoming`/`doing`/`working`/`governing` — the four READINGS of the one
 *     descent at its four closure regimes, over the same seed.
 *   - `perceive`/`act` — the inbound/outbound legs of the loop.
 *   - `reseed` — the spiral re-entry (the settled individual re-posed as the next
 *     seed; the cycle is closed by the sibling `playing` faculty).
