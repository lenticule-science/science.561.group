/**
 * skillful-work — the NUCLEAR QUARTET reading of an agent's work.
 *
 * This is the pure quartet LOGIC the agent reading (`agent.mts`) consolidates onto the
 * interior bulk — NOT a stored carrier of declared booleans. A unit of an agent's work
 * is typed by two commuting institutional nuclei, identified with the agent's two
 * non-communicating boundary faces:
 *   - σ (saturation = MEANING-closure)   = the INSIDE / knowing face settled
 *                                          (the ≤_k interior-knowledge orbit reflects).
 *   - Δ (transfer   = EXECUTION-closure) = the OUTSIDE / playing face settled
 *                                          (no open affordances remain to act on).
 * These are the same σ and Δ the agent `character` doc already names as "the institutional
 * nuclei" (χ is the third). By the Nuclear Quartet Theorem (two commuting nuclei ⇒
 * π = σ∘Δ is itself a nucleus, idempotent because they commute), applying neither/σ/Δ/both
 * yields EXACTLY four sub-algebras = the four types of skillful work:
 *
 *   ¬σ ¬Δ  raw A              → Inquiry    (⊥ absurd)   inside open,  outside open
 *    σ ¬Δ  Fix(σ)\H*          → Procedure  (one middle)  inside settled, outside open  — knows WHAT, still routing HOW
 *   ¬σ  Δ  Fix(Δ)\H*          → Derivation (other middle) inside open, outside settled — HOW is fixed rules, WHAT is a novel judgment
 *    σ  Δ  H* = Fix(σ)∩Fix(Δ) → Process    (⊤ stable)    inside settled, outside settled
 *
 * The quartet's determination order is order-ISOMORPHIC to relating's bilattice knowledge
 * order ≤_k: it is computed as the ≤_k JOIN of the two closure charges, so inquiry lands on
 * ⊥ absurd and process on ⊤ stable with the two single-closure types on the two incomparable
 * middles. We CONSUME relating's proven `joinKnowledgeValue` for that order — we do not
 * re-author it. The assignment of which middle charge (potential/active) labels σ-only vs
 * Δ-only is a coordinate LABELING of the two symmetric ≤_k middles, NOT a claim that
 * meaning-closure is epistemically "for"; this quartet is a sibling instance of FOUR on the
 * (σ, Δ) closure axes, not the for/against census the faces carry.
 *
 * Origin: the gsu-ccs relational-machine spec (skillful-work / inquiry / derivation /
 * procedure / process), grounded on math/nuclear-quartet-theorem.md.
