/**
 * writing/captp — OCapN / CapTP object-capability transport, realized through the
 * OUT (playing) face: distributed object-capabilities as a *-autonomous concurrent
 * game system.
 *
 * CapTP (the Capability Transport Protocol of the Spritely/Goblins/OCapN lineage —
 * the wire beneath E, Goblins, and the W3C-incubating OCapN) carries object
 * references across a network, delivers messages to them, and — its signature
 * move — PIPELINES PROMISES: you may send a message to the *not-yet-resolved
 * result* of a prior message, so a multi-call interaction settles in one round
 * trip instead of one per call. That promise-pipelining is exactly the
 * *-autonomous composition our OUT face already is:
 *
 *   sturdyref            = a LOCUS you may play, named unforgeably + its holder
 *                          (playing: a design's locus / the capability's grant)
 *   delivery (invoke)    = the CUT / interaction (playing's interaction normal form)
 *   a promise            = a not-yet-settled answer locus (the codomain `1·1·…` side
 *                          of the cut, the result region the prior play opens)
 *   promise pipelining   = the cut COMPOSED BEFORE RESOLUTION: deliver to the answer
 *                          locus by cutting the next invocation's design against the
 *                          prior invocation's *result design*, with no settle between
 *
 * This is the out-face TWIN of WMAP's across-face ActivityPub: WMAP's `Activity` is
 * a meme crossing the membrane; CapTP's `Delivery` is a move played at a locus. It
 * is NOT a second ontology — a CapTP capability IS the `Capability` carrier the
 * activitypub OCap brick already authored (authority by possession of a move, gated
 * by `canInvoke`), and the cut is `@emsenn/playing`'s genuine `cut`, not a copy.
 *
 * Layering: this consumes relating's stable root apex (`carrier`) and the stable
 * `@emsenn/playing` root (`design`, `daimon`, `cut`, `composeChronicles`, `Design`)
 * — never a playing internal subpath — and reuses the activitypub `Capability`
 * carrier + `canInvoke` gate. This brick is a PURE VALUE LAYER: carriers plus the
 * compose/invoke functions. The wire framing (the bootstrap object, GC/drop
 * messages, three-party handoff, the actual socket) is a later brick — recorded as
 * a frontier in dev/docs/notes/2026-06-25-captp-as-playing.md.
