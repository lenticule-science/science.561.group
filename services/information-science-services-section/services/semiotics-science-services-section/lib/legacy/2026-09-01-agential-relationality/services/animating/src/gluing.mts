/**
 * gluing — the holographic gluing node: animating's apex.
 *
 * animating is not a morphism and not a descent chain. It is a HOLOGRAPHIC BULK
 * whose boundary is the disjoint union of three typed faces — communicating
 * (across), knowing (inside), playing (outside) — and whose hidden interior is the
 * agent. This module is that node:
 *
 *   - `face` settles one faculty's membrane log into a local section over its cover
 *     (a `Face`): how the agent is seen from one side.
 *   - `glue` glues the three local sections into the interior agent — the GLOBAL
 *     SECTION over the three-cover boundary U = communicating ∪ knowing ∪ playing.
 *     The sheaf condition is the agent's `glued`: the corpus's replica
 *     Mayer–Vietoris theorem (settling-cohomology) makes this exact — the
 *     connecting map δ⁰ : H⁰(overlap) → H¹(U) vanishes iff a local section extends
 *     to a global section, so `glued` (H¹ = 0) means the three faces agree on their
 *     overlaps and the global section (the agent) exists. This is the first
 *     concrete bilattice-network-sheaf.
 *   - `project` restricts the agent back to its three boundary views — the
 *     holographic encoding. By the holographic principle (the corpus reads it at
 *     the settling regime: the interior is a projection of boundary data), you only
 *     ever see the agent through its three faces, never the bulk directly.
 *
 * H¹(U) carries the corpus's two readings of the obstruction: as an OBSTRUCTION it
 * is what cannot glue (faces disagreeing on overlaps); as a COORDINATION COST it is
 * the consensus needed to synthesize the global section — zero H¹ is a
 * coordination-free merge, non-zero H¹ requires consensus.
 * Grounding: content/_archive holographic-principle (cosmological-settlement) and the
 * proved replica-mayer-vietoris / settling-cohomology theorem.
 *
 * The three faces are THREADED, not absorbed: animating provides the face carriers
 * and the gluing; the sibling packages communicating/knowing/playing supply the
 * content over each face when mounted. The single-cover descent (./becoming …) is
 * the per-face settling SUBSTRATE this node glues over, not the shape of animating.
 * See dev/docs/notes/2026-06-21-animating-as-holographic-bulk.md.
