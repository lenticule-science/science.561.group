/**
 * agent — the interior agent: the bottom codomain of the agency descent, and the
 * perceive(input) → act(output) loop it is.
 *
 * The corpus defines an agent as `made-of: [perception, action, goal]` — a
 * perceive→act loop. This module builds that interior product from a settled
 * `DescentState`: the agent IS the glued individual sheaf the descent settles to
 * (`individuate`), read at its knowledge-least section as a membrane with an
 * inbound (perceive) side and an outbound (act) side, polarized by `handedness`.
 * The agent is the first concrete instance of the standing goal "derive
 * organizational state as a bilattice network sheaf": its `goal` is a
 * bilattice-charged target over that sheaf.
 *
 * The loop and the spiral:
 *   - `perceive(input)` folds an input membrane into the agent and re-individuates
 *     it — the inbound leg; threading prior membrane gives the agent memory
 *     (append-only, as the corpus's logs are).
 *   - `act(agent)` reads the open cells at the agent's outbound membrane as the
 *     commitments it can make — the outbound leg.
 *   - `reseed(agent)` re-poses the settled individual ("settled below, open above")
 *     as the seed of the next-scale descent — the spiral re-entry. The cycle is
 *     CLOSED by the sibling `playing` faculty (becoming → … → play → becoming);
 *     animating provides the re-seed; playing closes it.
