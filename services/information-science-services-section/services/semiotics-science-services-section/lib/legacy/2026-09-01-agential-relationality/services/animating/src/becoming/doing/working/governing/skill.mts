/**
 * skill — the single agent's SKILLFUL-WORK EXECUTION KERNEL.
 *
 * A `Skill` is a typed invocable: a documented method for one type of work, carrying its
 * declared nuclear-quartet `closureKind` (the (σ, Δ) type — see `skillful-work.mts`). The
 * closureKind is not a label; it is a runtime CONTRACT. `invokeSkill` runs a skill under that
 * contract and always returns a `SkillResult` — a Success or a structured `SkillError`, never
 * a thrown exception. Error is first-class state.
 *
 * The SkillResult coproduct is grounded in the bilattice FOUR, not imported as a foreign Result
 * monad: a Success carries a CLASSICAL charge (a settled direction, `potential`), an error
 * carries a NON-CLASSICAL one — `absurd` ⊥ for ABSENCE errors (the work reached nothing) and
 * `stable` ⊤ for CONTRADICTION errors (the world contradicts the skill's assumption). The
 * charges are consumed from relating; success/error is exactly the classical/non-classical
 * split of the FOUR the agent's faces already speak.
 *
 * Scope: this is the SINGLE-AGENT kernel — one skill, one invocation, one result, and the
 * quartet algebra over them. The multi-file, multi-agent SELF-IMPROVING WORKSPACE the gsu-ccs
 * agent-loop/engine/runbook/department specs describe (the message bus, PLANS/IDEAS, the
 * improvement loop) is social-scale and belongs in `organizing` (and overlaps the cockpit),
 * not here. Error ROUTING to that loop is the boundary this kernel hands off at.
 *
 * Origin: the gsu-ccs relational-machine spec (skills / skill-result / skillful-work).
