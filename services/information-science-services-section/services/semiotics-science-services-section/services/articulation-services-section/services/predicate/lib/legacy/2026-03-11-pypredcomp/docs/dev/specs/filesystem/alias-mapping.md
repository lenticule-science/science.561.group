# Alias mapping

Aliases are mutable name → cell-id mappings, useful when humans (or tools) need to refer to "the current X" rather than a specific content hash.
The cell pointed to is immutable; the alias's pointer is what changes.

## 1. Schema

An alias is a file entry:

```
$ROOT/aliases/<name>
```

The file content is the canonical JSON object `{"target": "<id>"}`.
The target is one of:

1. A **cell-id** (64 lowercase hex chars) — the most common case; the alias is a stable handle for "the current X".
2. An **entity-slug** (e.g. `office:planner`) — re-pointed when the incumbent changes; resolution carries on with that slug.
3. An **entity-kind prefix** ending in `:` (e.g. `task:`, `entry:`) — used by `paths-and-resolution.md` §3 to bind a sub-scope path (`scope:engineering/tasks`) to the entity-kind whose instances live in that sub-scope.
  Resolution at `./tasks/<leaf>` under `scope:engineering` yields `task:<leaf>`.
  ERP-module bindings (`scope:engineering/tasks → task:`, `scope:accounting/entries → entry:`) live in this class.

Reading an alias: read the file, decode the canonical JSON object, return the `target` string.
Callers validate the target's shape against their use-site (cell-resolvers require 64-hex; the path resolver tolerates the kind-prefix form).

## 2. Name alphabet

Alias names are lower-kebab-case strings, optionally containing `:` and `/`:

```
name = ["a"-"z" "0"-"9" "-"]+ ( ":" | "/" ["a"-"z" "0"-"9" "-"]+ )*
```

Examples: `current-charter`, `office:planner`, `rules/auto-dispatch`.

Names containing `..
`, leading `-`, NUL bytes, or other path-traversal characters are rejected (`PCS_INVALID_ID_FORMAT`).

## 3. Mutation

Aliases mutate via `alias` events:

```json
{
  "kind": "alias",
  "name": "current-charter",
  "cell_id": "<cell-id-or-empty>",
  "ord": <integer>,
  ...
}
```

Empty `cell_id` (empty string) means the alias is removed; the file is deleted.
Non-empty re-points the alias.

The substrate writes the file after the event is appended.
On crash mid-write, replay regenerates the file deterministically.

## 4. Resolution

`alias/<name>` HTTP request:

1. Validate name.
2. Read `$ROOT/aliases/<name>`.
  If absent → 404.
3. Read target from file (canonical JSON `{"target": "..."}
  `).
4. If the target is a 64-hex cell-id, return 302 redirect to `cell/<cell-id>`.
  If it's an entity slug, redirect to `entity/<slug>`.
  If it's a kind prefix (`<kind>:`), return 422 — the alias is structural, not directly resolvable on its own; the path resolver consumes it together with a leaf.

Programmatic resolution (MCP tool, CLI):

```text
resolve_alias(name) → cell_id | NotFound | InvalidName
```

A resolver SHOULD cache aliases with short TTL (default 60s); aliases are mutable but seldom in tight loops.

## 5. Convention

Common alias patterns:

- `current-charter` — the current charter's cell-id.
  Re-pointed when the charter is amended.
- `office:<office-name>` — the cell-id of the office's current incumbent (a persona-agent or personnel entry).
- `rules/active` — a manifest cell listing currently-active rule-ids.
- `views/<module>` — a manifest cell defining a projection view (messaging, tasks, ledger, etc.).

These are conventions, not requirements.
The system permits any name in the alphabet.

## 6. Why aliases

The substrate is content-addressed: every cell has a stable hash-identity.
Aliases give names where humans need them without compromising the immutability story.
Alias mutation is recorded in the event log; the history of "what current-charter pointed to over time" is queryable.

This is the same shape as Git refs vs Git objects.

## 7. Conflict on federation

Two peers may both define an alias `current-charter` pointing to different cell-ids.
Federation merge produces $\top$ at `(node:peer, alias:current-charter, ?)
`; the substrate honestly records the disagreement.
The local resolution preference is per-node configuration: prefer-local, prefer-most-recent, or surface-as-disagreement (the alias `current-charter` returns 409 with both candidates).

The default is prefer-local: each node's own `current-charter` is what its `alias/current-charter` returns.
