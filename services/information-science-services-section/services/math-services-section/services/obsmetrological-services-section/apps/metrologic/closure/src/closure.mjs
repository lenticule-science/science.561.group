// closure.mjs — the closure ordinal κ as a morphism, and the regime it determines.
//
// The CLOSURE ORDINAL of (L, Φ) is the least α with F(α+1) = F(α): the stage at which the iteration
// reaches its least fixed point, lfp(Φ). `closureOrdinal` is the morphism that finds it — walking the
// ordinals 0, 1, 2, …, ω, ω+1, …, ω·2, … and testing idempotence at each.
//
// It is HONEST about the boundary. A search to a notation bound either returns κ (with its regime) or
// reports that no fixed point was found below the bound — which, when the closure really is aperiodic
// (κ ≥ ω₁, an ordinal with no countable notation), is what *must* happen: there is no κ to return, and an
// unbounded search would never halt. We do not pretend to decide the undecidable; we expose exactly where
// the iteration would run forever, and let the caller choose how far to look.
//
// REGIME, read off κ — the four-regime dichotomy as a property of where the closure stabilizes:
//   finite      κ < ω         strict / finite
//   scott       κ = ω         Scott-continuous (the ω-limit is already fixed)
//   transfinite ω < κ < ω₁    a non-Scott-continuous firing pushes κ past ω, but it is still countable
//   aperiodic   κ ≥ ω₁        no countable κ — the search never finds one (witnessed, not asserted)
